"Mom says pregnant Texas teen found dead was ""there at the wrong time""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/savanah-nicole-soto-texas-pregnant-teen-death-family-speaks-out/,"The family of Savanah Nicole Soto, a pregnant 18-year-old who was missing for several days before she and her boyfriend were found dead in a vehicle in San Antonio, Texas, is speaking out about the teen's death. Soto was last seen at her apartment on Friday, Dec. 22, just one day before she was scheduled to be induced to give birth, a week past her due date. She lived in the apartment with her boyfriend, Matthew Guerra, who was also reported missing. On Tuesday, the bodies of a woman and man, believed to be the missing couple, were found in a vehicle by a searcher who contacted Soto's family, who then called police. The woman was pregnant, police said, and the unborn child was also dead. In a statement Wednesday, police said the victims, an 18-year-old woman and 22-year-old man, each had a gunshot wound. CBS affiliate KENS reports the investigation has been categorized as a capital murder case. San Antonio Police Chief Bill McManus called it a ""very, very perplexing crime scene"" and said investigators were looking into the possibility of homicide. ""We believe it was the missing woman and her boyfriend but we can't confirm that"" until the medical examiner completes the examination, McManus said. Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, tells CBS News that she believes her daughter was in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""I think it had something to do with him and things that he was doing, not my daughter,"" Cordova said, referring to Matthew Guerra. ""My daughter just was there with him and they didn't want ... they didn't want someone to say what happened, somebody that's going to say it's so-and-so or this is what he looked like. She just was there at the wrong time.""  Soto's mother and aunt both said that the relationship between Soto and Guerra had been abusive. ""He used to abuse her,"" Soto's mother said. ""And I told her to get out of the relationship, but she ??she was hard-headed, she wouldn't listen. But I think this time she was going to leave him already. That's what I'm hearing."" Soto's aunt, Laura Cordova, said the couple ""would fight a lot,"" describing their relationship as ""rocky."" She said her niece had had bruises and that Guerra ""would hit her throughout her pregnancy.""  Police have not commented on or verified allegations of abuse. Soto's mother said that the couple had disagreed about whether she should be in the delivery room when Soto gave birth. Cordova said that Guerra had not wanted her in the room, but her daughter said she could be there. CBS News has reached out to Guerra's family but has not heard back. Guerra's father spoke with CBS affiliate KENSand acknowledged his son had a criminal history, including an assault charge involving Savanah last year. ""He didn't hang around the best crowd,"" Guerra's father told the station. However, he said the two had been in a good place since living together and were excited about the baby, a boy they planned to name Fabian. ""They were inseparable. Was it a perfect relationship? No, but she definitely was not a prisoner there,"" he said. ""Her and Matthew were both overjoyed and couldn't wait for Fabian's arrival."" Soto's brother, Jordan Corona, told CBS News that police told him there was no weapon found at the scene, and that both Guerra and Soto were shot in the back of the head.  Laura Cordova said a detective told her that Guerra was found slumped over in the backseat of the vehicle, and that Soto was in the front. Soto was holding a car seat, according to her mother. ""She had the car seat on her lap, so she was going to the hospital,"" Gloria Cordova said. Police have said that the car might have been at the location where it was found ""possibly for three or four days."" Soto's relatives expressed shock and grief at the loss of the teen and her baby. The family lost another child just last year ??Soto's brother, Ethan. Laura Cordova said she saw her niece just days before her disappearance that Soto was ""counting the days"" and excited to be a mother. ""I wish she was here with her baby,"" Laura Cordova told CBS News, through tears. Gloria Cordova said her daughter ""was like a mini mom"" who was looking forward to motherhood. ""She was like my backbone. She's the one that kept me going,"" she said. ""I don't want to believe that she's gone. It hurts too much. She was my only daughter."" She said Soto's brothers are ""shattered"" by the loss of their sister. ""It broke my heart when they told me she passed away. And even knowing how she passed away, it kills me so bad,"" Cordova said. ""But now I just have to think now she's with her brother in heaven. She's not feeling no pain no more.""

The aid package ??the final of 2023 ??will include arms and equipment, including air defense munitions, anti-armor munitions, ammunition for high mobility artillery rocket systems, and more than 15 million rounds of small arms ammunition, a State Department spokesperson said to CBS News. ""Our assistance has been critical to supporting our Ukrainian partners as they defend their country and their freedom against Russia's aggression,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, urging Congress to ""swiftly"" approve further aid to Ukraine. The U.S. ""continued to demonstrate its enduring commitment to Ukraine's defense against Russia's brutal aggression with the announcement of additional arms and equipment to help Ukraine defend its territory and protect its people,"" the State Department spokesperson said. The announcement came after President Biden hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House earlier this month. It also came as Ukraine's allies have dramatically scaled back their funding of Ukraine, which has fallen to its lowest level since the start of the war, according to the German-based Kiel Institute'sUkraine aid tracker. Earlier this month, Senate Republicansblocked additional Ukraine fundingover a dispute with Democrats over U.S. border security. On Dec. 14, Hungaryblocked about $55 billion in European Union aid for Ukraine. ""The decisions we make now are going to determine the future for decades to come, particularly in Europe,"" Mr. Biden said during his meeting with Zelenskyy. ""And this is one of those moments. Congress needs to pass the supplemental funding for Ukraine before they break for the holiday recess, before they give [Vladimir] Putin the greatest Christmas gift they could possibly give him."" ?”Margaret Brennan contributed to this report.

House GOP request documents on Biden's involvement in Hunter Biden defying subpoena,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-biden-defying-subpoena-house-republicans-documents-white-house/,"Washington ??The Republican leaders of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Wednesday asked the White House to turn over information about President Biden's alleged involvement in his son Hunter Biden's decision not to comply with a congressional subpoena for a deposition, expanding its impeachment inquiry into the president. In a letter to White House counsel Edward Siskel, Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan requested documents and communications between White House staff in the Executive Office of the President and Hunter Biden or his lawyers regarding his scheduled deposition, which was supposed to happen on Dec. 13. But Hunter Biden defied the subpoena from the Oversight Committee for a closed-door interview with lawmakers, appearing briefly outside the U.S. Capitol to reiterate that he would answer questions only in a public setting. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters later that day that the president was ""familiar with"" what his son was going to say in his statement. ""In light of Ms. Jean-Pierre's statement, we are compelled to examine the involvement of the President in his son's scheme to defy the Committees' subpoenas,"" Comer, who leads the Oversight Committee, and Jordan, chairman of the Judiciary panel, said in their letter to Siskel. They argued that Jean-Pierre's remark suggests that Mr. Biden ""had some amount of advanced knowledge"" that Hunter Biden would refuse to comply with the subpoena for testimony. The Republicans set a Jan. 10 deadline for the White House to provide the records regarding Hunter Biden's deposition. They are also seeking documents from staff in the Executive Office of the President related to a comment Mr. Biden made on Dec. 6 denying that he interacted with his son and brother's foreign business associates. Comer and Jordan said the president's ""advanced awareness"" that his son would not answer questions from lawmakers behind closed doors ""raises a troubling new question that we must examine: whether the President corruptly sought to influence or obstruct the Committees' proceeding by preventing, discouraging, or dissuading his son from complying with the Committees' subpoenas."" ""Such conduct could constitute an impeachable offense,"" they wrote. Beyond Jean-Pierre's comment, it's unclear how much Mr. Biden knew about his son's plan not to appear for the deposition. Hunter Biden told reporters on Dec. 13 that he would answer at a public hearing ""any legitimate questions"" from Comer and Oversight Committee members, and accused the GOP leaders of the three committees conducting the impeachment inquiry of ""distorting the facts."" Republicans have been investigating Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings for nearly a year and claim Mr. Biden was enriched by his son and brother's overseas work and accepted bribes. They have produced no evidence of wrongdoing by the president or that he benefited financially from his family's business ventures. Still, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced in September that he would be launching a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, and the House's GOP majority voted earlier this month to formalize the probe. Comer and Jordan said they will pursue proceedings to hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress for defying the subpoena from Republicans. Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

Social Security beneficiaries could see these big changes in 2024,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-cola-maximum-payment-2024-taxes/,"Social Security recipients could face some big changes in 2024, thanks to inflation and tax-related adjustments that will impact everything from monthly benefits to how much recipients owe in taxes. For one, the top benefit in 2024 will approach $5,000 per month. The old-age and disability program provides monthly payments to more than 70 million people, ranging from children to retirees. Those benefits are credited with keeping millions of Americans from slipping into poverty, with monthly checks adjusted each year to keep up with inflation. In 2024, benefits will increase by 3.2%. Many of the changes in 2024 are related tocost-of-living adjustments which will not only boost recipients' monthly income, but potentially subject more of their earnings to taxes, experts say. That can be a surprise to some Social Security beneficiaries who mistakenly believe their checks are tax-free. ""There is a wide misperception, and it's not helped by social media at all, that Social Security recipients don't pay taxes, and that's not at all the case,"" said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at the Senior Citizens League. Understanding your tax liability for Social Security payments is important because otherwise a senior citizen might not have saved enough for their golden years, Johnson added. ""You might have to save 20% more than you thought you might need, or 25% more,"" she said. Here are some of the changes to expect in 2024. The Social Security Administration announced its annual COLA in October, pegging the 2024 change on the most recent inflation data. Seniors and other recipients will get an increase of 3.2%, a much smaller boost than the 2023 and 2022 increases of 8.7% and 5.9%, respectively. The average benefit will rise to $1,907 per month in 2024 from $1,848 this year. But retirees who receive the maximum Social Security payout will see much higher earnings, with their monthly checks jumping to $4,873 in 2024, according to the agency. That's about an additional $170 per month in each paycheck compared with the current year. So who gets the top payout? Not many people, noted Johnson. ""The only way to get it is if you're [Apple CEO] Tim Cook and you have been paying the maximum"" into your payroll taxes, she joked. ""It's like the 1% to 2%."" The Social Security Administration says that the top benefit is received by people who have earned the maximum taxable earnings since age 22, and then waited to claim their benefits at age 70. Workers pay Social Security tax up to a maximum income level, which was $160,200 in 2023. Earnings above that threshold aren't taxed for Social Security. And while people can claim their Social Security benefits as early as 62 years old, they can increase their monthly checks if they delay claiming, with the maximum payout going to those who wait until they turn 70 years old to claim. For instance, top earners who claim at 62 years old would get $2,710 per month in 2024. More Social Security beneficiaries could see a higher tax bill in 2024 because of a quirk in the Social Security system. Beneficiaries must pay federal income taxes on their benefits if they earn above a relatively modest threshold. This threshold hasn't changed since 1984, even though inflation and benefits have risen considerably since then. More seniors are subject to income tax on their retirement income each year because their benefits generally rise each year with the COLA. And many have incomes from sources other than Social Security, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, which can cause more of their Social Security benefit to face taxes. Here are the thresholds: Fewer than 10% of Social Security recipients paid taxes on their benefits in 1984, but that's risen to about 40% currently, according to the Social Security Administration. ""We are dealing with the tax side of inflation here, and inflation can drive up your taxes"" because the threshold hasn't changed in almost 40 years, Johnson noted. Some workers may also face higher taxes for Social Security in 2024. That's because the IRS adjusts the maximum earnings threshold for Social Security each year to keep up with inflation. In 2023, workers paid Social Security taxes on income up to $160,200. For an individual, the tax rate is 6.2% of earnings, with their employer paying another 6.2% into the program. But that threshold will rise to $168,600 in 2024, which means higher earners are likely to face higher Social Security taxes next year. Correction: An earlier version of this story on December 27, 2023, misstated that the additional monthly increase was $318.

"As base pay rises, some companies are fighting back with fees, layoffs",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doordash-pizza-hut-minimum-wage-hikes-california-new-york-city/,"An estimated 10 million low-wage earners are getting a raise in the new year, but not all employers are taking higher minimum wages across 22 states in stride. Pizza Hut islaying off more than 1,200 delivery drivers in California ahead of the state's nearly 30% increase in its minimum wage, to $20 an hour from $16. PacPizza, operating as Pizza Hut, and Southern California Pizza Co. ??another Pizza Hut franchise, both gave notice of layoffs impacting workers in cities throughout the state, Business Insiderreported, citing notices filed with the state. At least one Pizza Hut franchisee also charges a service fee, citing the increased cost of operating in California in its tacking on an 8.5% service charge to the bill, according to the Los Angeles Times. ""Pizza Hut is aware of the recent changes to delivery services at certain franchise restaurants in California. Our franchisees independently own and operate their restaurants,"" a Pizza Hut spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an emailed statement. ""Where franchisees have elected to make changes to their staffing approach, access to delivery service will continue to be available via Pizza Hut's mobile app, website and phone ordering,"" the spokesperson added. Fast-food chains including McDonald's have already said menu prices would rise in the state to counter the higher labor costs.

On the other side of the country, DoorDash is getting rid of tipping prompts in New York City and upping its service fee to all transactions, but is still letting customers add gratuity once the delivery is finished, the delivery app said. The changes come in response to a new minimum wage hike for app-based food delivery workers in New York City, who must be paid at least $17.96 an hour plus tips, or what DoorDash called ""the ill-conceived, extreme minimum pay rate for food delivery workers in New York City [that] will have significant consequences for everyone who uses our platform.""

Apple Watch ban is put on hold by appeals court,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/apple-watch-ban-on-hold-appeals-court-ruling/,"Apple won a temporary reprieve in the legal battle over its Apple Watch product, with an appeals court on Wednesday ordering a pause on a ban of the product that went into effect on Tuesday. The court gave the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) until January 10 to respond to Apple's request for a longer stay while the issue moves through the courts, according to the ruling. The Apple Watch ban would have paused sales on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, which include a blood oxygen monitor that is at the center of a patent dispute. The ITC had banned the import of the watches because it ruled that the tech giant had illegally used blood oxygen technology from Masimo, a medical tech company. In a statement provided to CBS News, Apple said it was ""thrilled to return the full Apple Watch lineup to customers in time for the new year.""  It said both models, ""including the blood oxygen feature,"" would be available for purchase in Apple stores in the U.S. beginning Wednesday, and on the company's website starting at noon Pacific time on Thursday. The company also noted that along with the federal appeals process, it was pursuing various legal and technical options, including submitting proposed redesigns of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for approval.  Masimo did not immediately responded to requests for comment. The Biden administrationlet the ITC decision stand on Tuesday, effectively blocking the sale of the watches in the U.S. On Tuesday, Apple filed an emergency motion seeking court permission to begin selling two of its most popular watches again until a final decision on its broader appeal in abitter patent disputeis decided. Apple had cut off sales right before the Christmas holiday. In a motion filed Tuesday, the Cupertino, California-based company said it would suffer ""irreparable harm"" if previous court orders remained for the two weeks it said the U.S. International Trade Commission will take to respond to its appeal. The disruption will likely cost Apple about $300-$400 million in holiday-season sales, estimated Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. That's a relative drop in the bucket for Apple, given that industry analysts are expecting the company to generate nearly $120 billion in sales this quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season.

Dick Smothers said his brother died peacefully on Tuesday at home with his family, according to the National Comedy Center statement. His death followed a recent battle with lung cancer, which was diagnosed at stage II. Tom and Dick Smothers broke new ground with their hit show, ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,"" which aired on CBS and won an Emmy in 1969.

The brothers looked back fondly on the show and its impact on audiences, as well as their relationship. ""People laughing is holy,"" Tom said. ""And if you can be part of that, and control it, and create it, it's the best thing ever."" Dick added, ""When someone said, 'What's the happiest time in your life,' it's standing on that stage with my brother a few inches away on my right and having that feeling with that audience. That defines my whole life. There's nothing better."" Journey Gunderson, the executive director of the National Comedy Center, praised Smothers' talent as an entertainer as well as the brothers' trailblazing role in melding sketch comedy and performing with political satire. ""Tom Smothers was not only an extraordinary comedic talent, who, together with his brother Dick, became the most enduring comedy duo in history, entertaining the world for over six decades ??but was a true champion for freedom of speech, harnessing the power of comedy to push boundaries and our political consciousness,"" Gunderson said in a statement.

The thousands of weddings expected on what is normally a big holiday could even set a record ??thanks in part to the date, which this year creates a repeating numerical sequence of 1-2-3-1-2-3. In the industry, that repeating date is known as a ""specialty date,"" according to the Associated Press. There were similar lines on April 3, 2021 (4/3/21) and Dec. 13, 2014 (12/13/14), according to county clerk Lynn Goya in a 2021 interview with the Associated Press. These dates are ""always immensely popular,"" said Goya, noting that more than 1,800 tied the knot on Dec. 13, 2014. The number to beat this New Year's Eve is 4,492. That record was set on July 7, 2007 - or 7/7/07. The Associated Press said that since 2018, the city typically records between 450 and 550 New Year's Eve marriages, but multiple wedding venues and planning companies said they are expecting far more ceremonies this year.

Sims told CBS News that crews quickly contained the fire, and no one was injured. The fire originated inside a vacant, one-story commercial building located near one side of the highway. Video footage from the scene that the Louisville Fire Department shared with CBS News showed the structure completely ablaze before sunrise. Additional footage shared later by CBS affiliateWLKY showed the flames extinguished, although at the time some traffic disruptions remained, the station reported. Earlier, all eastbound and westbound lanes were blocked along a stretch of I-64, transportation officials announced on social media. They said several hours after the fire broke out that inspectors were on site to evaluate a nearby bridge on the interstate, and noted that the portion of I-64 surrounding it would likely remain closed for a while. KYTC bridge inspectors are on site and assessing the I-64 West bridge near mile marker 3.4, following a nearby building fire. This portion of I-64 West is anticipated to be closed for several hours and motorists are advised to seek an alternate route. https://t.co/nAj6pXSZit The vacant building where Wednesday's blaze ignited has caught fire before. Sims told CBS News that Louisville firefighters have responded to two fires at the site in the last year alone, with a car fire causing at least one of those incidents. What caused the blaze Wednesday morning is still under investigation. Sims said an arson team was on-site evaluating the situation along with other fire officials.

Inside the unclaimed baggage center where lost luggage finds new life,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unclaimed-baggage-lost-luggage-store-scottsboro-alabama/,"Amid the bustling holiday travel season, as travelers navigate the shift from Christmas to New Year's, major airports are keeping pace. But the story doesn't always end at the baggage claim. For some, their belongings embark on an unexpected journey to a small Alabama town. At the Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro, Alabama, lost luggage finds a new lease on life. This unique store stretches over a city block, filled with items from unclaimed airline baggage. Visitors here can find anything from a glitzy Rolex and a 1980s-style keyboard guitar to rare movie props, ancient violins and designer clothes. Bryan Owens, who inherited the business from his father, describes the store's inventory with a hint of wonder. ""If these bags could talk, what a story they'd have to tell,"" he said. Among the unusual finds are suits of armor. ""We've had more than one suit of armor come through, believe it or not,"" Owens said. Airlines typically have a 90-day window to reunite lost bags with their owners. After this period, the bags are deemed lost, and the airlines compensate the flyers. Owens then purchases these unclaimed bags by the truckload. The contents, ranging from wearable items to electronics, are cleaned, data-wiped and priced for resale. ""The thing that separates us from a thrift store is thrift stores are things that people, people don't want anymore. These are items that we have that people didn't wanna part with,"" said Owens. The store has seen its share of valuable items and sentimental items including a $22,000 Rolex and wedding dresses. The idea for the store came to Owens' father 53 years ago after a chat with a friend at a Washington D.C. bus line. With a modest investment of $300 and a pickup truck, the business was born. Today, the store is not just a retail space but a tourist destination, drawing a million visitors yearly to Scottsboro, a town of 15,000. People like Marilyn Evans, who detoured hours on her drive from Florida to Tennessee, find the journey worthwhile. ""Definitely way out of the way, way farther away than I thought it was gonna be. But yes, it's been worth it so far. It's been a lot of fun,"" Evans said. The most popular section of the store is electronics, featuring the latest gadgets alongside some oddities like firearms or boat engines. The store has housed surprises over the years: a live rattlesnake, a 40-carat emerald, Egyptian artifacts and even a guidance system for an F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, which was returned to the Navy.

Amazon to show ads in Prime Video content starting January 2024,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-prime-video-ads-subscription-january-streaming-netflix/,"Amazon will begin airing ads in its Prime Video television shows and movies on January 29. That means Prime Video subscribers, who pay $139 per year for a Prime membership, will see ""limited"" ad interruptions starting on that date, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement to customers. People who pay for the stand-alone Prime Video subscription, which costs $8.99 per month, will also see ads starting on January 29. However, Amazon said subscribers can avoid the ads by paying an extra $2.99 per month for an commercial-free subscription. Prime Video's new subscription strategy comes amid an industry-wide shift toward a tiered subscription model. Streaming platforms such as Disney+, Netflix, Hulu and Peacock have already introduced ad-supported subscription options alongside more costly ad-free offerings. ""This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time,"" Amazon said in the email. ""We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers."" Amazon, which first announced the ad-free tier in September, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. Streaming services are embracing tiered subscription models to boost revenue as they pour massive amounts of money into costly content amid the escalating streaming wars. The tiered model boosts sales by bringing in both ad dollars and incentivizing some subscribers to shell out more money for higher-tier subscriptions, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Amazon's advertising business, which includes Amazon marketplace advertisements and Freevee, has served as a major revenue source for the company. In the third quarter, the tech giant raked in roughly $12 billion in revenue from advertising, up 26% from the same quarter last year, the company's financial statement shows.

Michigan Supreme Court rejects bid to keep Trump off 2024 ballot,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michigan-supreme-court-decision-donald-trump-2024-primary-ballot/,"Washington ??The Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal from a group of voters in the state who challenged former President Donald Trump's candidacy for the presidency under the Constitution's ""insurrection clause."" In a brief order, the state high court denied a request from four voters to review a Michigan Court of Appeals decision that allowed Trump to remain on the Republican presidential primary ballot. The Michigan Supreme Court, composed of seven justices, said it is ""not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court."" The order was not signed, and a vote count was not noted. The decision means that Trump's name will be listed on Michigan's presidential primary ballot. The primary is scheduled for Feb. 27. One justice, Elizabeth Welch, dissented and wrote the only legal issue properly before the state supreme court is whether the lower courts erred in finding the Michigan secretary of state lacks the authority to exclude Trump's name from the presidential primary ballot. Welch wrote that she agrees with the Court of Appeals that Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson must place Trump on the primary ballot regardless of whether he is disqualified from holding office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, known as the ""insurrection clause."" Under Michigan law, Welch wrote, ""the secretary of state is not legally required to confirm the eligibility of potential presidential primary candidates. She lacks the legal authority to remove a legally ineligible candidate from the ballot once their name has been put forward by a political party in compliance with the statutes governing primary elections."" Trump praised the Michigan Supreme Court for its decision, saying in a social media post it ""strongly and rightfully denied the Desperate Democrat attempt"" to remove him from the ballot. The decision from Michigan's top court comes one week after the Colorado Supreme Court found that Trump is disqualified from holding office under the Constitution's ""insurrection clause."" Though the Colorado high court ordered Trump's name to be kept off the state's presidential primary ballot, it paused its decision until Jan. 4 to allow him time to appeal. Trump's campaign has said it intends to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Colorado Supreme Court's decision. Colorado's primary is scheduled for March 5. The Michigan case was brought by four voters in the state on behalf of Free Speech for People, an advocacy group that is behind challenges to Trump's eligibility for the White House in several states. The group argued that the former president is disqualified from public office under Section 3 because of his conduct surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Enacted after the Civil War, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment bars anyone who has sworn an oath to support the Constitution and engaged in insurrection against it from holding federal or state office. Unlike in Colorado, the Michigan Court of Claims did not conduct a trial or reach the question of whether Trump was disqualified under the insurrection clause. Instead, Judge James Robert Redford dismissed the case on technical grounds, finding it involved a political question that cannot be decided by the courts and concluding that the political parties determine their presidential candidates for the primary. A three-judge Court of Appeals panel agreed with the lower court in rejecting the challenge to Trump's candidacy, finding that the Michigan secretary of state's role in the context of presidential primary elections is limited and, beyond publishing a list of potential candidates, ""purely administrative."" The head of each political party ultimately identifies which candidates will be placed on the primary ballot, the judges said. ""The Secretary of State's role in presidential primary elections is chiefly that of an administrator,"" the Court of Appeals panel concluded. ""In particular, when it comes to who is or is not placed on the primary ballot, the statutory scheme leaves nothing to the Secretary of State's discretion. As the Court of Claims explained, who to place on the primary ballot is determined by the political parties and the individual candidates."" The judges wrote it would be ""improper"" to decide whether to declare Trump ineligible for the presidency at this time. ""At the moment, the only event about to occur is the presidential primary election. But as explained, whether Trump is disqualified is irrelevant to his placement on that particular ballot,"" the appellate court found. The cases in Michigan and Colorado are among others brought in more than two dozen states that seek to keep Trump off the 2024 ballot because of his actions surrounding the Jan. 6 riot. Many, however, have been dismissed, while secretaries of states in places like New Hampshire and Oregon have said they don't have the authority to exclude Trump from the ballots in their states. The decision from the Colorado Supreme Court finding Trump cannot hold the presidency was unprecedented and marks the first time a presidential candidate has been deemed ineligible for the White House under Section 3. Trump's expected appeal of that ruling sets up a politically charged showdown before the Supreme Court that has huge implications for the 2024 presidential election.

Expert-approved social media health trends ??and a few you should skip,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-media-health-trends-experts/,"From the rise of the""girl dinner"" to videos normalizing gut health issues, social media was full of wellness-related trending topics over the past year. But which ones stuck out to experts as try-worthy trends, and ones are you better off skipping? We asked a range of experts across nutrition, fitness, mental health and beyond what social media trends stuck out to them this year both for good and bad reasons. Those they approved of centered around safe and approachable wellness additions while those on their disapproved list focused on videos that lack professional backing or scientific information. Here are some of the recent trends they highlighted: Move over charcuterie, the hashtag #CottageCheese stole the spotlight this year with more than 1.3 billion views on TikTok ??and the high-protein ingredient is expert approved. ""Cottage cheese is the frontrunner in my opinion,"" says Amanda Holtzer, a registered dietician based in New Jersey. ""For a long time, cottage cheese has gotten a bad rap. Many people are turned off by the texture. However, cottage cheese is an excellent source of protein, and can be super versatile. Just half a cup of low-fat cottage cheese has about 80 calories and 14 grams of protein."" TikTok users definitely got creative and optimized its versatility, transforming the chunky dairy product into a must-try ingredient for recipes like cottage cheese ice cream and cottage cheese cookie dough, garnering tens of millions of views. ""In 2023 the FoodTok community added cottage cheese into popular sweet and savory dishes for a healthy, protein-rich take,"" TikTok shared in a statement to CBS News, adding cottage cheese even made it into the app's ""Year on TikTok 2023"" list. Originated by TikTok creatorHope Zuckerbrow, ""cozy cardio"" ??a trend that focuses on a more mindful, low-pressure relationship with exercise ??has amassed more than 15.9 million views on the app. Morit Summers, personal trainer and founder ofForm Fitness Brooklyn, says the trend is great ??and even does a version of it herself. ""People need to move, and if doing it from the comfort of their homes in their cozy clothing and with the lights dimmed, then great!"" she says. ""Our lives are really stressful and there is no reason for all fitness to also feel that way ??for example, going to a gym or a class with bright lights and blaring music. Movement is movement, so whatever movement makes you feel good is the right movement."" 2023 was the year walking got a re-brand with trends like 12-3-30 and the ""hot girl walk""really taking off. ""12-3-30 is a trend that I think simplifies the idea of getting your daily dose of exercise and is so approachable because all it asks you to do is walk,"" says Dr. James Wantuck, co-founder and chief medical officer of PlushCare and associate chief medical officer of Accolade. ""12% incline at 3mph for 30 minutes on a treadmill is a great way to get your heart racing."" For some, 12-3-30 can be pretty extreme, says Summers, who noted some may get a bigger benefit out of the trend using a lower incline. ""The goal when doing a challenge should be to get through it but also... having built habits, not feeling burnt out,"" she says. The""hot girl walk"" is another great low to no-incline option that encourages anyone to take time for physical and mental health through an accessible form of fitness. ""Our generation sees walking, or at least did... as not really a valid form of exercise,"" Mia Lind, the ""hot girl walk"" creator, previouslytold CBS News, pointing to running videos or YouTube ab workouts as what she typically saw online. ""For some people starting out, (those) can be really scary, and walking is a very accessible form of exercise. You can be at any fitness level to begin (and) it's completely free."" Using social media as a replacement for a real therapist is a no-go, experts say. ""Mental health is a big deal, and many people are turning to armchair psychologists for advice about how to manage their mental health. This is dangerous and also not effective,"" Wantuck says. ""To really get the help you need, you should find a trusted, trained professional to assist you."" Another mental health trend that concerns mental health experts are self-diagnosis and ""un-diagnosis"" videos posted online that have no professional backing.  Though the self-diagnosis trend has been around for a while, Benjamin Goldman, a licensed mental health counselor, says he has more recently seen the trend transform further. ""Something that is more alarming for me is the rise of un-diagnosis videos, where creators and users will self-diagnose and then basically determine that they are undiagnosed,"" he says. While the trend is meant to be humorous, Goldman says users often ""dismiss their perceived mental health disorders and use broad diagnostic criteria to invalidate the seriousness of mental illness."" The representation and normalization of mental health challenges online can be a positive thing, but Goldman says without a professional approach, this trend can lead to misinformation about disorders and their symptoms and even increase stigma. ""It turns these mental health diagnoses into a joke, which can discourage people from seeking clinical help if you're watching a video like this and having the message reiterated that mental health diagnoses are dismissible,"" he says. ""Using humor to discuss mental health can be helpful in other contexts on on social media... but there's this fine line between using humor as a way of doing psychoeducation versus reiterating this idea that one can just, quote-unquote, 'quit their mental illness.'"" False or misleading information is rampant on social media, and this year experts especially saw increased misinformation regarding weight loss, specifically related to the interest indrugs like Ozempic.  ""Everything from 'nature's Ozempic' ??aka berberine, an ineffective and potentially dangerous supplement ??to overblown (and) fear-inducing side effects like 'Ozempic face' and 'Ozempic butt,'"" Wantuck says. ""For trusted information and to learn and possibly get a prescription for these drugs, seek the counsel of a physician, and don't trust most of what you see on TikTok.""

Detroit Pistons lose NBA record 27th straight game in one season,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pistons-lose-27-straight-games-nba-record/,"The Detroit Pistons have made NBA history. Detroit became the league's first team to lose 27 straight games in a season, falling 118-112 to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night. The Nets beat the Pistons on Saturday in Brooklyn, handing them their 26th consecutive defeat to match the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers for the most losses in a row within one season. Detroit no longer shares the unwanted mark. Next up is the overall record of 28 straight losses, set by the Philadelphia 76ers from late in the 2014-15 season through early 2015-16. At least matching the record seems likely with a game Thursday night against the NBA-leading Boston Celtics on the road. The game against Brooklyn, like the season, started with some hope. Detroit led 9-1 and had a 14-point lead in the first quarter before poor shooting, defense coupled with turnovers paved the way for Brooklyn to extend the Motor City's misery. The Nets outscored the Pistons by 13 in the second quarter to lead 61-54 at halftime. Cade Cunningham scored 18 of his 41 points in the third quarter and made a 3-pointer early in the fourth to give Detroit a 97-92 lead. Just as fans who nearly filled Little Caesars Arena started cheering with passion heard at a playoff game, the Nets went on a 13-0 run to take the lead for good. Cunningham did his part to give the team a shot to finally win, but he didn't have much help and even he had a turnover  Bojan Bogdanovic did score 23 points before fouling out and after leaving Cam Johnson wide open for a 3-pointer that gave Brooklyn a six-point lead with 1:40 to go. Jaden Ivey, the No. 5 pick overall last year, missed 9 of 12 shots as the Nets backed off him and welcomed the guard to shoot. In the final minute, fed-up fans started to chant, ""Sell the team! Sell the team!"" though Pistons owner Tom Gores was not in the building to hear it.",2023-12-28,
Top U.S. officials meet with Mexican president amid record migrant crossings,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blinken-mayorkas-mexico-migrant-crisis/,"President Biden dispatched top officials to Mexico City this week for a meeting with President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador that the White House described as ""productive."" It came as migrants are crossing the U.S. border in record numbers and Congress has been unable to reach a consensus on funding border security. The White House National Security Council said in a statement Thursday that ""LÃ³pez Obrador has taken significant new enforcement actions yet we have a lot more work to do together,"" and that top White House officials will meet again with Mexican leaders in Washington in January. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Mr. Biden's homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall traveled to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with LÃ³pez Obrador. Senior Biden administration officials said late Wednesday that the meeting lasted over two hours. One senior administration official said that Mexico ""came prepared to share a plan with us on how they were taking the work that they are already doing"" to help stem the flow of migrants into the border. ""We have seen in recent days a pretty significant reduction in in border crossings,"" one of the officiasl said. ""So again, this is not something that the U.S. and Mexico will be able to address on or off on their own. So I would say the majority of our conversation actually focused on work that we're doing together in the region."" The senior administration officials said Mexico agreed on the need to crack down on smuggling. They also said Blinken and LÃ³pez Obrador discussed ""legal pathways"" for migrants, which one official described as one of the ""strong intersecting interests between President Biden and President LÃ³pez Obrador."" The meeting came as mayors of New York, Chicago and Denver said Wednesday that they have no more capacity for migrant arrivals, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has continued to send migrants to those cities. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Wednesday that all three cities ""have reached a point where we are either close to capacity, or nearly out of room."" ""Without significant intervention from the federal government, this mission will not be sustained,"" Johnson said.  In response to the mayors, White House spokesperson Angelo FernÃ¡ndez HernÃ¡ndez said in a statement that federal immigration clinics have provided assistance to roughly 10,000 migrants in applying for work permits. He he noted that Temporary Protected Status and work permit applications are being decided in 30 days on average. The White House said last week that Mr. Biden spoke to LÃ³pez Obradorabout ""ongoing efforts to manage migratory flows in the Western Hemisphere."" The two leaders ""agreed that additional enforcement actions are urgently needed so that key ports of entry can be reopened across our shared border,"" the White House said. The visit comes after Border Patrol processed nearly 50,000 migrants who entered the U.S. illegally in just five days last week. In November, Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 191,000 migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully. This month, as many as 10,000 migrants were apprehended daily at the southern border. Mexico's president said last week he's willing to help address the issue, but he wants the U.S. to provide more aid to the region and ease sanctions Cuba and Venezuela. ""We have always talked about addressing the causes [of migration]. The ideal thing is to help poor countries,"" LÃ³pez Obrador said, according to the Associated Press. In the U.S., Congress has debated border policy changes for weeks as part of a larger package including assistance to Ukraine and Israel. To convince Republicans ??who want harsher border security measures ??to support more foreign aid, Democrats are considering drastic limits on asylum and increased deportations.

Judith Weinstein Haggai, who was an Israeli, American and Canadian national, came under fire in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her husband, Gadi Haggai, 72, a dual U.S.-Israeli national. Both were believed to have been taken hostage, butlast week Israeli officials said they had confirmedGadi Haggai's death. According to a spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the couple lived, Judy Weinstein Haggai was also ""fatally wounded"" by Hamas gunmen in the Oct. 7 attack. Both bodies are still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, the spokesperson said.

Weinstein Haggai had family ties to the New York area. Gov. Kathy Hochul tweeted: ""Heartbroken to learn that Judith Weinstein was killed during the October 7 attack. My heart is with her family abroad and those still here in New York.  May her memory be a blessing and may the many hostages still in captivity be brought home safely."" Senator Chuck Schumer called the news ""devastating."" ""I'm grieving and praying for them. We must keep working to bring the hostages home. We cannot wait,"" he wrote. The couple's daughter, Iris, told CBS News in late November that she had seen video evidence that her father was killed, and said at that time that she had had no updates about her mother.

Gaza family tries to protect newborn quadruplets amid destruction of war,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gaza-israel-war-newborn-quadruplets/,"As Israel continued its deadly bombardment in Gaza overnight, there was new life amid the carnage for one family with newborn quadruplets.

But al-Masri, a mother of seven, is doing her best to keep her family safe, sheltering with them in a school building. Her husband, Ammar, has given up his food so other members of his family can eat. ""Strikes occur very often,"" al-Masri says. ""My husband Ammar wakes up to cover the newborns, because we were worried broken glass would fall on them."" The war is taking an especially steep toll on families, and Israel says it has no plans to stop the bombing until Hamas is destroyed. It accuses Hamas of using civilians, like the al-Masris, as human shields. Over 80 days of bombardment has turned entire neighborhoods to rubble and killed over 21,000, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Humanitarian workers say hospitals have been decimated and facilities are overwhelmed.

Nikki Haley fails to mention slavery when asked about cause of Civil War,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-fails-to-mention-slavery-when-asked-about-cause-of-civil-war-new-hampshire-town-hall/,"Berlin, New Hampshire ??Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley declined to mention slavery as the cause of the Civil War during a campaign event Wednesday evening in Berlin, New Hampshire. ""What was the cause of the United States Civil War?"" a male attendee asked Haley during a town hall. The former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations appeared to be taken aback by the question and paused before answering. ""Well, don't come with an easy question,"" Haley joked. ""I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do. What do you think the cause of the Civil War was?"" The questioner ??who later identified himself to reporters off camera as ""Patrick"" ??immediately shot back at Haley, saying he's not the one running for president. Haley attempted to further elaborate her response, but still with no mention of slavery.  ""I think it always comes down to the role of government, and what the rights of the people are,"" Haley said. ""And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need to tell you how to live your life."" When the voter followed up with Haley on why she wasn't mentioning slavery in her response, she asked, ""What do you want me to say about slavery?"" Haley's exchange was met with some applause from the town hall's audience. However, the criticism was almost immediate, with many taking to social media to react, including President Biden, who tweeted late Wednesday night: ""It was about slavery."" ""This isn't hard, condemning slavery is the baseline for anyone who wants to be President of the United States, but Nikki Haley and the rest of the MAGA GOP are choking on their words trying to rewrite history,"" said Jaime Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in a statement to CBS News after the town hall. The confrontation comes amid Haley's growing momentum in New Hampshire, with the latest polls showing she has been gaining on former President Donald Trump, something no other Republican presidential candidate has been able to do in the Granite State. Earlier this month, she was endorsed by Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. Throughout her campaign, Haley has championed South Carolina's 2015 removal of the Confederate flag on the State House grounds under her tenure as governor. The removal came in the wake of the 2015 mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston in which a white supremacist killed nine Black people. As part of her stump speech, Haley often tells the story of the moments leading up to the flag's removal. ""50% of South Carolinians saw the Confederate flag as heritage and tradition, the other 50% of South Carolinians saw it as slavery and hate,"" Haley told voters during a town hall in Spirit Lake, Iowa, earlier this month. ""My job wasn't to judge either side,"" Haley said. ""My job was to get them to see the best of themselves and go forward."" Haley often pitches to voters that ""the tone at the top matters"" in bringing the country together across different and sensitive issues. ""We were able to bring that Confederate flag down,"" she said in Spirit Lake. ""We didn't have riots, we had vigils. We didn't have protests, we had hugs. And South Carolinians showed the world what strength and grace look like. That's how you do it.""

Lauren Boebert to seek reelection in a different Colorado district,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lauren-boebert-seek-office-different-congressional-district-colorado-2024/,"Rep. Lauren Boebert, the Republican congresswoman representing a huge swath of western and southern Colorado, announced Wednesday that in the 2024 election, she plans on changing districts. Boebert said in a Facebook video that she intends to seek office in Colorado's 4th Congressional District, which covers the Eastern Plains, currently represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Ken Buck. Buck said last month that he won't seek reelection in 2024, due to the Republican Party's support of former President Donald Trump and, what he called an embrace of conspiracy theories. He's represented the district since 2015. ""I wanted to let you, my constituents and supporters, hear directly from me about my plans for the 2024 election cycle and the importance of maintaining a conservative voice for Colorado in Congress as well as keeping our Republican House majority,"" Boebert wrote in the caption of that Facebook video. ""I cannot put into words how grateful I am for everyone who has steadfastly stood alongside me over the past year and beyond,"" she continued. ""I am going to do everything in my power to represent the 3rd District well for the remainder of this term as I work to earn the trust of grassroots conservative voters in the 4th District to represent them in 2025."" The full video can be seen here. Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, which Boebert currently represents, covers the northwest corner of the state south through Grand Junction to the southeast corner, east to Pueblo and the southern central portion of the state. That district has had both Democratic and Republican representatives over the past few decades. The 4th Congressional District includes most of the eastern half of the state, as well as Douglas County and Greeley. Aside from one-term Democratic Rep. Betsy Markey, who served from 2009 to 2011, the district hasn't seen a Democratic representative since 1973. Boebert won her 2022 bid for reelection against Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by just over 500 votes with over 300,000 ballots cast. The race was so close it triggered an automatic recount. Frisch said he's planning to run for that district again. Frisch, in a statement on Thursday, touted the work he and his campaign team have done in this election and criticized Boebert generally, but also on an incident where she was removed from the Denver Center for the Performing Arts during a performance of Beetlejuice. ""Boebert is running scared from CD-3 because she knows she can't match our campaign's ability to connect with voters and the hard work we have put in to provide them with a common sense voice in Congress, including driving over 45,000 miles and holding hundreds of public meetings in every corner of this great district. Even before the Beetlejuice debacle that embarrassed her constituents, our campaign was polling ahead of Boebert because voters saw that we were showing up in their communities and appreciated the hard work, authenticity, sincerity, and independence that this campaign embodies."" It's unclear how many people will run for that seat in total, but Republicans Russ Andrews, Jeff Hurd and Curtis McCrackin announced their intent to challenge Boebert in the primary for the 3rd Congressional District. Democrats Anna Stout and Adam Withrow, along with Frisch, as well as three third-party candidates said they'll be seeking that seat too. In 2022, Buck won reelection handily with over 60% of the vote. Boebert will face a crowded field in the primary election with six other Republican candidates having announced their intent to run. Whoever wins that bid will then face the winner of the Democratic primary; three people have announced their intent to seek the Democratic nomination. In a statement, Boebert said she'll continue her efforts fighting for conservatives in Colorado and the U.S. and against ""Democrat socialists and communists"" and ""Hollywood elites and national progressive groups."" Boebert was first elected to her seat in 2020, beating 10-year incumbent Scott Tipton, who Trump endorsed at the time. Boebert lives near the western end of the state in Garfield County, hundreds of miles from the 4th Congressional District. If elected to represent the 4th Congressional District, she said she would relocate to that district. Members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they represent, only in the same state. Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib called Boebert ""cowardly"" for ""abandoning"" her constituents, in a statement. ""Lauren Boebert can run, but she can't hide,"" Murib said, in part. ""The good people of Western and Southern Colorado didn't wait for an election to beat Lauren Boebert -- we scared her straight and chased her out of her own district. With this carpetbagging move, Lauren Boebert has shown herself to be everything she claims she isn't: a typical swampy politician looking for a reason to call Washington D.C. home. She's a loser in CD3, and she'll be a loser in CD4."" Trent Leisy, who's running for the seat Boebert is now seeking, criticized the move from a strategic standpoint. ""Lauren Boebert has officially given the Democrats a Congressional seat by switching districts to run in my race,"" he tweeted Wednesday. ""This move would give the Democrats control of the House. Lauren should be a fighter and keep her district red! In Congress, I would NEVER vote to expand FISA and am running in a district that I actually live in.""

University chancellor says he was fired for appearing in porn,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/university-wisconsin-la-crosse-chancellor-joe-gow-fired-porn-videos/,"Watch the CBS Reportsdocumentary ""Speaking Frankly: Porn"" in the video above. Former University of Wisconsin-La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow said Thursday that regents fired him because they were uncomfortable with him and his wife producing and appearing in pornographic videos. The regents voted unanimously during a hastily convened closed meeting Wednesday evening to fire Gow.  After the vote, Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and Regents President Karen Walsh issued statements saying the regents had learned of specific conduct by Gow that subjected the university to ""significant reputational harm."" Rothman called Gow's actions ""abhorrent"" and Walsh said she was ""disgusted."" But neither of them offered any details of the allegations. Gow told The Associated Press in a phone interview Thursday morning that regents had discovered that he and his wife, former UW-La Crosse professor Carmen Wilson, had been producing and appearing inpornographic videos. He maintained that he never mentioned UW-La Crosse or his role at the university in any of the videos and the firing violated his free speech rights. ""My wife and I live in a country where we have a First Amendment,"" he said. ""We're dealing with consensual adult sexuality. The regents are overreacting. They're certainly not adhering to their own commitment to free speech or the First Amendment."" Gow also complained that the regents never told him what policy he violated and he was never given a hearing or other opportunity to present his case. He said he's contemplating a lawsuit. ""I got an email last night saying I was terminated,"" Gow said. ""I wish I would have had the opportunity to have a hearing. When reasonable people understand what my wife and I are creating, it calms them down."" Gow had planned to retire as chancellor at the conclusion of the spring 2024 semester and transition into a role teaching communication courses. But Rothman said Wednesday evening that he planned to file a complaint with UW-L's interim chancellor, Betsy Morgan, seeking a review of Gow's tenure.  Rothman said in an email to the AP on Thursday morning that Gow failed to act as a role model for students, faculty and the community and mistakenly believes the First Amendment equates to a ""free pass to say or do anything that he pleases."" ""Good judgement requires that there are and must be limits on what is said or done by the individuals entrusted to lead our universities,"" Rothman said.  Rothman added that Gow served at the pleasure of the regents and was not entitled to any specific process.  ""That should be abundantly clear to him,"" Rothman said.  Gow took heavy criticism in 2018 for inviting porn actor Nina Hartley to speak at UW-La Crosse. He paid her $5,000 out of student fees to appear. Ray Cross, then UW system president, reprimanded him and the regents refused to give him a raise that year. Gow said then that he was exercising the system's free speech policies. Gow and his wife star in a YouTube channel called ""Sexy Healthy Cooking"" in which the couple cooks meals with porn actors. They also have written two e-books, ""Monogamy with Benefits: How Porn Enriches Our Relationship"" and ""Married with Benefits ??Our Real-Life Adult Industry Adventures"" under pseudonyms.

"What to know about nitazenes ??powerful, ""under the radar"" synthetic opioids",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nitazenes-fentanyl-substance-use-drug-supply-opioid-death-colorado/,"A Colorado overdose death has been linked to a new formulation of nitazenes, a class of powerful opioid analgesics being increasingly seen in the illicit drug market. Nitazenes have been around for decades, experts told CBS News, and have been seen in multiple formulations. The person who died in Colorado had used a formulation called N-Desethyl etonitazene. The man died in mid-2023, Denver officials said, but laboratory testing about the substance he overdosed on was not returned until recently.  It's believed to be the first time that formulation was found in an overdose death, according to the Boulder County Coroner's office. The coroner told CBS News that while Denver, Colorado, has seen a decrease in fentanyl overdoses, use of nitazenes has emerged ??which ""raises new concerns."" Here's what to know about nitazenes. Nitazenes were first developed in the 1950s and early 1960s, said Claire Zagorski, a chemist, paramedic and translational scientist in Austin, Texas. At the time, they weren't illicit drugs, but were intended to be sold commercially. That never happened, Zagorski said, and in recent years, those original formulations have been used as a backbone by illicit drug manufacturers to make new synthetic opioids amid a crackdown on substances like fentanyl. ""When you have a backbone of one drug to start with, there is almost limitless ways to modify it,"" Zagorski said. Modifications are made by adding substances to that backbone in a laboratory setting. Theillicit use of nitazenes remains rare, according to Dr. Wilson M. Compton, the deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. However, testing for nitazenes is not conducted in every overdose death, Compton said, so ""we don't actually know the complete universe of how many deaths are due to these potentially very toxic compounds."" Compton said that according to reports by the Drug Enforcement Administration, nitazenes make up ""much less than 1%"" of the opioids that the agency seizes. However, Zagorski said she expects to see those numbers rise. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see more and more nitazenes because they're still under the radar to a lot of America and it takes time to implement advisories for law enforcement to all get on the same page of what they need to look for,"" she said. There are multiple forms of the drug circulating, including the N-Desethyl etonitazene version seen in Colorado. Other common formulations include isotonitazenes, metonitazenes, etonitazenes and protonitzenes, according to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation. ""It really is like Whack-a-Mole. Like they just keep coming and coming and coming,"" Zagorski said, because of the way the drugs are developed. Now that stopping fentanyl is a national priority, she expects to see more nitazenes being developed by illicit manufacturers and used as authorities to catch up. ""We're seeing all of these odd chemicals kind of popping up. It's kind of a divide and conquer strategy, and it's hard to keep it keep track of things like that,"" she said. Both Zagorski and Compton described nitazenes as ""very potent,"" but how much risk they pose varies based on the different formulations. N-Desethyl etonitazene and another formulation, etonitazene, are ""about 10 times as potent as fentanyl,"" Zagorski said. Fentanyl is about 50 times more potent that heroin, according to the DEA. ""This is really going to hit with a wallop,"" Zagorksi said. Compton said that some versions of nitazenes can be even more dangerous than carfentanil, which is a fentanyl compound that is about 100 times more potent than fentanyl itself. ""They're even more potent than something that we're already quite concerned about,"" said Compton. Nitazenes can also be mixed into other drugs that are sold illicitly, meaning people may not know that they're consuming something so dangerous, Compton said. ""Nitazenes being mixed with other illicit drugs emphasizes the increased risk of harm or death. Illicit drug suppliers often mix drugs to increase potency or lower costs,"" the Boulder County coroner's office said. It's not clear if the man who died in Colorado knew he was ingesting N-Desethyl etonitazene. There also hasn't been much research into how nitazenes interact with other substances, so there may be unexpected side effects from mixing it with other drugs or alcohol, Compton said. Naloxone, a medication that reverses opioid overdoses and is more commonly known by the brand name Narcan, can reverse an overdose that involves nitazenes, experts said. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that binds to the same receptors in the brain that are affected by nitazenes, Zagorski said. Compton said that anyone who experiences a nitazene overdose and is revived with naloxone should seek medical treatment because some nitazines may be long-acting. ""There's a concern that as the naloxone wears off, they may fall back into a coma and have respiratory depression,"" Compton said. Naloxone also works on powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil, and is available over-the-counter. Kerry Breen is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

"Social media apps made $11 billion from children, teens in 2022",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-instagram-tiktok-snapchat-children-advertising-2022-harvard-study/,"When it comes to children's mental health and privacy, their loss translates into massive gains for social media companies: $11 billion, to be exact. That's according to a new Harvardstudythat shows social media platforms last year generated $11 billion in revenue from advertising directed at children and teenagers, including nearly $2 billion in ad profits derived from users age 12 and under. Snaphat, TikTok and Youtube reaped the highest share of those billions, approximately 30% - 40% combined, according to the findings. ""Although social media platforms may claim that they can self-regulate their practices to reduce the harms to young people, they have yet to do so, and our study suggests they have overwhelming financial incentives to continue to delay taking meaningful steps to protect children,"" said S. Bryn Austin, one of the authors of the study and a professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Youtube, Instagram and Facebook brought in hundreds of millions of dollars last year in profits from advertising targeting children who use the platforms, generating $959.1 million, $801.1 million and $137.2 million respectively, Harvard researchers found. That same year, Instagram, Tiktok and Youtube generated a whopping $4 billion, $2 billion and $1.2 billion respectively in revenue from ads aimed at users in their teens. The study, which draws from public survey and market research data from 2021 and 2022, focuses on two age groups within the U.S.: children 12 years old and younger and adolescents ranging from 13 to 17 years old. Researchers examined advertising activities of both groups across six popular social media platforms: Youtube, X, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat. Social media platforms have increasingly come under fire as health officials express concern over the potential harmful effects of apps like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok on young peoples' mental health. U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in May called for stronger guidelines for social mediause among children and teens, pointing to a growing body of research that the platforms may pose what he described as a ""profound risk"" to young people's mental health. As reported by CBS' 60 Minutes in June the number of families pursuing lawsuits has grown to over 2,000 since last December. More than 350 lawsuits are expected to move forward this year against TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Roblox and Meta ??the parent company to Instagram and Facebook. More recently, attorneys general in 33 statesfiled a federal lawsuit against Meta in October, claiming that the company harmed young users on its Facebook and Instagram platforms through the use of highly manipulative tactics to attract and sustain engagement, as it illegally collected personal information from children without parental consent. Also in October, New York lawmakers proposed legislation to prohibit minors from accessing what they described as ""addictive feeds"" without parental consent.

"Some Chick-fil-A locations should open on Sundays, lawmakers say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chick-fil-a-sunday-rest-stop-new-york-bill/,"Chick-fil-A locations operating at rest stops along New York State's 500-mile Thruway could in the future be required to remain open seven days a week ??effectively forcing the chain to keep some locations open on Sundays, according to a new bill from New York lawmakers. The bill, introduced earlier this month, would require restaurants operating in the state highway system's rest areas to remain open every day of the week. The measure is at odds with Chick-fil-A's policy of closing Sundays and letting workers ""worship if they choose.""  ""While there is nothing objectionable about a fast food restaurant closing on a particular day of the week, service areas dedicated to travelers [are] an inappropriate location for such a restaurant,"" states the bill, which noted that Chick-fil-A already operates at seven of the Thruway's 27 service areas. Chick-fil-A did not respond to a request for comment on the measure. The bill wouldn't extend to other Chick-fil-A locations in the state, or even to the seven locations already open at Thruway service areas. It also excludes temporary concessions such as farmer's markets. Some Republican lawmakers are pushing back against the New York bill, with South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham calling the proposal ""insanity"" on social media. ""This is a blatant violation of the company's constitutional rights, and we're not going to let that happen without a fight,"" the senatorsaidin a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, showing himself outside a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Manhattan.

The ruffled feathers, however, may be just that, as Chick-fil-A's Thruway locations are already locked in.

"When to take your Christmas tree down, and how to dispose of it",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-to-take-your-christmas-tree-down-and-how-to-dispose/,"Have you taken down your Christmas tree yet? Chances are you haven't. Whether you chose to decorate a natural or artificial tree this year, you're probably still admiring the sight of it in your living room, and in no immediate rush to part with the warm, magical feeling it brings. Of the approximately 94 million U.S. households that display a Christmas tree, fewer than 20% take down their Christmas tree in December, according to polls by online sources like Bob Vila and Architectural Digest. Still, unless you live in the North Pole and work for a man named Kris Kringle, you'll probably want to take down your Christmas tree sometime before the end of January. Most Americans do, according to an Opendoor.com survey which found that 84% of respondents said they took down their Christmas decorations in January, with 51% aiming for New Year's Day or thereafter. When exactly should you take your Christmas tree down? The answer for the most part depends on the type of tree you have, your religious beliefs and where you live. Here are guidelines on when to box up or throw out your Christmas tree, along with tree recycling and disposal options. For those who have an artificial tree, the decision of when to take your Christmas tree down depends on personal preference. But there are traditional timelines you can follow to keep from procrastinating. The Epiphany on January 6, is when many religiously observant Christians choose to take down their Christmas tree. Theholy day commemorating the biblical story of the arrival of the three wise men bearing gifts, marks the end of the Christmas season. Owners of real trees also have safety concerns and local recycling dates to bear in mind when deciding when to take down their Christmas tree. ""A dry tree will have brown needles visible in patches on the tree and will shed needles easily when touched. The small branches will also be brittle and break when bent,"" Tim O'Connor, executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. Dry trees should be promptly removed from the home, according to the National Fire Protection Association. The dryer they become, the more flammable they are, warns the association, which is why natural Christmas trees should never be placed near fireplaces, stoves or candles. ""Christmas trees do not start fires,"" O'Connor said. ""Fires are started by a heat source or electrical spark, [so] be sure your tree is not exposed to a potential source of fire."" While rare, Christmas tree fires can escalate rapidly, warns the NFPA on its website. Between 2017-2021, U.S. fire departments responded to an annual average of 150 Christmas tree fires in homes, NFPA figures figures show. Of those 150 fires, two in five involved some kind of lighting or electrical component. Candles, a common fire starter, caused 8% of Christmas tree fires. You can download a Christmas tree safety tip sheet from the NFPA here. When disposed of responsibly, a real Christmas tree can be a gift that keeps on giving. The same evergreen that filled your home with holiday cheer and the scent of pine is a renewable resource that can be turned into mulch orcompost, the former being the most popular way of recycling Christmas trees. Many cities and towns offer Christmas tree recycling services including curbside pick-up or drop-off locations where trees and wreaths are put into a wood chipper and turned into mulch. Make sure to remove every last wire hook and strand of tinsel before taking part in any tree recycling services. Aside from recycling and mulching, another use for old Christmas trees is in your backyard, where they can provide shelter for birds, squirrels and other backyard critters during wintertime. Cut boughs and limbs can be used to shelter plants from cold frosts. Some online sites recommend feeding your old Christmas tree to goats, pigs and other livestock. Others caution against the idea, however, noting that pesticides and chemicals commonly injected into and sprayed onto farmed Christmas trees make them unsuitable for use as food for animals. Old Christmas trees are also used as protective barriers againsterosion. If you live in a coastal town, try doing a quick online search into local conservation organizations that might be interested in your old Christmas tree. Most importantly, never burn a Christmas tree in an indoor fireplace or wood-burning stove. ""The sap that is still in the wood would create issues in a fireplace or stove ... chimney or vent stack where sap could collect,"" according to O'Connor. Nor should you burn your Christmas tree in an outdoor fire pit, according to several commercial retailers of outdoor stoves. This is not only because Christmas trees hold a lot of sap and moisture and will create a lot of smoke, but because coniferous tree needles contain nitrogen and terpenes, a substance that is highly toxic when burned. Burning your old Christmas tree will also release all of its stored carbon into the atmosphere, according to a 2020reporton Christmas trees from North Dakota State University. What's the worst way to dispose of your Christmas tree? Leaving it on the curb for the garbage collector to pick up and most likely dump in a landfill. ""Materials buried in landfills will break down into methane, which is a greenhouse gas more harmful than carbon dioxide,"" Tom Kalb, extension horticulturist at North Dakota State University, states in his report.",2023-12-28,Fewer than 20% of U.S. households take down their Christmas tree in December.

Boebert says she'll seek office in a different district in 2024,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lauren-boebert-seek-office-different-congressional-district-colorado-2024/,"Rep. Lauren Boebert, the Republican congresswoman representing a huge swath of western and southern Colorado, announced Wednesday that in the 2024 election, she plans on changing districts. Boebert said in a Facebook video that she intends to seek office in Colorado's 4th Congressional District, which covers the Eastern Plains, currently represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Ken Buck. Buck said last month that he won't seek reelection in 2024, due to the Republican Party's support of former President Donald Trump and, what he called an embrace of conspiracy theories. He's represented the district since 2015. ""I wanted to let you, my constituents and supporters, hear directly from me about my plans for the 2024 election cycle and the importance of maintaining a conservative voice for Colorado in Congress as well as keeping our Republican House majority,"" Boebert wrote in the caption of that Facebook video. ""I cannot put into words how grateful I am for everyone who has steadfastly stood alongside me over the past year and beyond,"" she continued. ""I am going to do everything in my power to represent the 3rd District well for the remainder of this term as I work to earn the trust of grassroots conservative voters in the 4th District to represent them in 2025."" The full video can be seen here. Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, which Boebert currently represents, covers the northwest corner of the state south through Grand Junction to the southeast corner, east to Pueblo and the southern central portion of the state. That district has had both Democratic and Republican representatives over the past few decades. The 4th Congressional District includes most of the eastern half of the state, as well as Douglas County and Greeley. Aside from one-term Democratic Rep. Betsy Markey, who served from 2009 to 2011, the district hasn't seen a Democratic representative since 1973. Boebert won her 2022 bid for reelection against Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by just over 500 votes with over 300,000 ballots cast. The race was so close it triggered an automatic recount. Frisch said he's planning to run for that district again. Frisch, in a statement on Thursday, touted the work he and his campaign team have done in this election and criticized Boebert generally, but also on an incident where she was removed from the Denver Center for the Performing Arts during a performance of Beetlejuice. ""Boebert is running scared from CD-3 because she knows she can't match our campaign's ability to connect with voters and the hard work we have put in to provide them with a common sense voice in Congress, including driving over 45,000 miles and holding hundreds of public meetings in every corner of this great district. Even before the Beetlejuice debacle that embarrassed her constituents, our campaign was polling ahead of Boebert because voters saw that we were showing up in their communities and appreciated the hard work, authenticity, sincerity, and independence that this campaign embodies."" It's unclear how many people will run for that seat in total, but Republicans Russ Andrews, Jeff Hurd and Curtis McCrackin announced their intent to challenge Boebert in the primary for the 3rd Congressional District. Democrats Anna Stout and Adam Withrow, along with Frisch, as well as three third-party candidates said they'll be seeking that seat too. In 2022, Buck won reelection handily with over 60% of the vote. Boebert will face a crowded field in the primary election with six other Republican candidates having announced their intent to run. Whoever wins that bid will then face the winner of the Democratic primary; three people have announced their intent to seek the Democratic nomination. In a statement, Boebert said she'll continue her efforts fighting for conservatives in Colorado and the U.S. and against ""Democrat socialists and communists"" and ""Hollywood elites and national progressive groups."" Boebert was first elected to her seat in 2020, beating 10-year incumbent Scott Tipton, who Trump endorsed at the time. Boebert lives near the western end of the state in Garfield County, hundreds of miles from the 4th Congressional District. If elected to represent the 4th Congressional District, she said she would relocate to that district. Members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they represent, only in the same state. Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib called Boebert ""cowardly"" for ""abandoning"" her constituents, in a statement. ""Lauren Boebert can run, but she can't hide,"" Murib said, in part. ""The good people of Western and Southern Colorado didn't wait for an election to beat Lauren Boebert -- we scared her straight and chased her out of her own district. With this carpetbagging move, Lauren Boebert has shown herself to be everything she claims she isn't: a typical swampy politician looking for a reason to call Washington D.C. home. She's a loser in CD3, and she'll be a loser in CD4."" Trent Leisy, who's running for the seat Boebert is now seeking, criticized the move from a strategic standpoint. ""Lauren Boebert has officially given the Democrats a Congressional seat by switching districts to run in my race,"" he tweeted Wednesday. ""This move would give the Democrats control of the House. Lauren should be a fighter and keep her district red! In Congress, I would NEVER vote to expand FISA and am running in a district that I actually live in.""

Haley and Christie on collision course in New Hampshire's primary,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-hampshire-chris-christie-ad-nikki-haley-civil-war-comments/,"For two Republican presidential candidates facing a desperate moment in their attempts to overcome former President Donald Trump's frontrunner status in the GOP primary field, this week has already provided a stark contrast. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparked stinging pushback after she avoided talking about slavery on Wednesday in Berlin, New Hampshire, when a voter asked what she thought was the cause of the Civil War. The flub went viral and gained more attention.  Around that same time, a sparse ad from Chris Christie's campaign was publicly rolled out where the former New Jersey governor honed his verbal attacks on Trump. ""He caused a riot on Capitol Hill,"" Christie said in the direct to camera ad. ""He'll burn America to the ground to help himself. Every Republican leader says that in private. I'm the only one saying it in public. What kind of president do we want, a liar or someone who's got the guts to tell the truth? New Hampshire. It's up to you."" Haley and Christie are on a collision course in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary as both candidates seek to benefit from the state's quirky electorate where undeclared voters, who make up a major portion of the state's voters, can decide to cast ballots in the GOP primary on Jan. 23. ""Telling the truth isn't hard ??particularly when you believe in what you are saying,"" a source close to Christie replied."" The simplicity of Christie's ad and message conveys that when you believe in what you are saying, telling the truth is easy."" New Hampshire is likely the best chance for any Trump challenger to dent his standing early on, and Haley has seen a clear momentum according to a recent CBS News poll that had her in second behind the former president. In a campaign whose main focus is litigating Trump's faults and failures, Christie has staked his primary ambitions on a strong showing in New Hampshire. He hasn't shied away from his past support for the former president, but has made emphatic warnings about what Trump being the GOP nominee could mean for the party moving forward.  That tactic has earned him support in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Haley has relied on a more delicate approach to taking on Trump, who appointed her as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during his presidency. Even one of Haley's rivals from the right in the presidential primary, Vivek Ramaswamy, posted on social media that ""the shocking part isn't that Nikki failed to mention slavery."" ""It's that she failed to mention the 10th Amendment,"" Ramaswamy's post said. ""When you try to be everything to everyone, you're nothing to anyone."" Haley spent time on Thursday morning trying to clarify her answer. ""Of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that, that's unquestioned. always the case, we know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that,"" Haley said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. ""It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government."" Anxiety within the part of the GOP ready to move on from Trump has also led to Christie facing calls to drop out in hopes of helping Haley. In 2016, Trump's GOP challengers failed to consolidate behind a single alternative candidate in time to deny him the nomination, and there is fear that the same fate could play out again. As Haley faced quick pushback this week, the challenge of consolidating more Trump critics behind her came into sharper focus. ""The calls for Christie to drop out really are predicated on the idea that there's a lane for Nikki Haley, and that Nikki Haley could win, not only in New Hampshire, but then could go on to win the primary,"" said Lucy Caldwell, who was the campaign manager for former congressman Joe Walsh's longshot 2020 GOP presidential primary challenge to Trump. Haley's comment in Berlin, Caldwell said, helps ""show that maybe there is a continued role for someone like Chris Christie to keep the flame alive for pro-democracy, non-lying, non-pandering to extremist, Republicans.""

Colorado Republican Party appeals Trump ballot ban to U.S. Supreme Court,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-republican-party-appeal-u-s-supreme-court-trump-ballot-ban/,"The Colorado Republican Party on Wednesday appealed that state's Supreme Courtdecision that found former President Donald Trump is ineligible for the presidency, the potential first step to a showdown at the nation's highest court over the meaning of a 155-year-old constitutional provision that bans from office those who ""engaged in insurrection."" The first impact of the appeal is to extend the stay of the 4-3 ruling from Colorado's highest court, which put its decision on pause until Jan. 4, the day before the state's primary ballots are due at the printer, or until an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is finished. Trump himself has said he still plans to appeal the ruling to the nation's highest court as well. The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was added after the Civil War to prevent former Confederates from returning to government. It says that anyone who swore an oath to ""support"" the constitution and then ""engaged in insurrection"" against it cannot hold government office. The Colorado high court ruled that applies to Trump in the wake of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, intended to stop the certification of President Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. It was the first time in history that the provision was used to block a presidential contender's campaign. ""The Colorado Supreme Court has removed the leading Republican candidate from the primary and general ballots, fundamentally changing the course of American democracy,"" the party's attorneys wrote Wednesday. They said, ""Unless the Colorado Supreme Court's decision is overturned, any voter will have the power to sue to disqualify any political candidate, in Colorado or in any other jurisdiction that follows its lead. This will not only distort the 2024 presidential election but will also mire courts henceforth in political controversies over nebulous accusations of insurrection."" The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to take the case, either after the Colorado GOP's appeal or Trump's own appeal. If Trump ends up off the ballot in Colorado, it would have minimal effect on his campaign because he doesn't need the state, which he lost by 13 percentage points in 2020, to win the Electoral College in the presidential election. But it could open the door to courts or election officials striking him from the ballot in other must-win states. Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the plaintiffs seeking to disqualify Trump in Colorado, said on a legal podcast last week that he hopes the nation's highest court hurries once it accepts the case, as he expects it will.  ""We obviously are going to ask for an extremely accelerated timeline because of all the reasons I've stated, we have a primary coming up on Super Tuesday and we need to know the answer,"" Grimsley said. More than a dozen states, including Colorado, are scheduled to hold primaries March 5 ??Super Tuesday. To date, no other court has sided with those who have filed dozens of lawsuits to disqualify Trump under Section 3, nor has any election official been willing to remove him from the ballot unilaterally without a court order. The Colorado case was considered the one with the greatest chance of success, however, because it was filed by a Washington D.C.-based liberal group with ample legal resources. All seven of the Colorado high court justices were appointed by Democrats. However, the unprecedented constitutional questions in the case haven't split on neatly partisan lines. Several prominent conservative legal theorists are among the most vocal advocates of disqualifying Trump under Section 3. They argue the plain meaning of the constitutional language bars him from running again, just as clearly as if he didn't meet the document's minimum age of 35 for the presidency. The half-dozen plaintiffs in the Colorado case are all Republican or unaffiliated voters. Trump has been scathing about the cases, calling them ""election interference."" He continued that on Wednesday as he cheered a ruling earlier that day by the Michigan Supreme Court leaving him on the ballot, at least for the primary, in that state. ""The Colorado people have embarrassed our nation with what they did,"" Trump said on Sean Hannity's radio show.",2023-12-28,"The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to take the case, either after the Colorado GOP's appeal or Trump's own appeal.

"Wellness trends to watch for 2024: The Ozempic ""ripple effect"" and more",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/expert-predictions-health-wellness-trends-2024/,"The new year means new opportunities for wellness trends. After a year dominated by mental health discussions, COVID variants and weight-loss drugs hitting the market, we're looking toward 2024 and what health topics will capture consumers most. To get an idea of what we might see, we asked experts in different corners of the health and wellness space what they expect to make waves in the year ahead. Experts expect to see a resurgence in weight loss-focused trends in 2024 prompted by drugs like Ozempic becoming more mainstream. Celebrity endorsementshelped the new weight-loss drugs gain traction. Their popularity also appears to have spurred interest in supplements making weight-loss claims, likeberberine, touted online as ""nature's Ozempic"" ??even though the evidence doesn't really back it up. ""Ozempic will create even more ripple effects throughout food, beverage and dietary supplement markets in 2024,"" says Frank Jaksch, CEO at bioactive ingredient company Ayana Bio. ""I expect that we'll see an increase in products that contain berberine."" He also expects that ""snack-makers and fast-food chains will offer smaller portions and more nutritious, wholesome ingredients that match the preference changes with Ozempic and piggyback off of this latest wave of health-conscious consumers."" After a few years of chipping away atdiet cultureand leaning into movements like body positivity, attitudes may be shifting. A recentForbes Health/OnePoll surveyfound the top New Year's resolution for 2024 is back to physical health ??with the majority of respondents citing fitness as a top resolution ??after a few years of mental health occupying the top spot. While millions of Americans have been sporting smartwatches to track their exercise, sleep and other health metrics for a few years now, experts predict 2024 will bring a new level of wearable health tech. ""Wearable devices and smartwatches will continue to move beyond monitoring and add more screening features to warn us of health issues before they become bigger problems,"" predicts Christine Lemke, co-founder and CEO of health data company Evidation. ""The functionality of these devices will continue to transition from passive to proactive."" Artificial intelligence, which is already being incorporated into some health settings, will also become a bigger player next year. ""Your 'second opinion' may come from a computer instead of a physician, as our ability to analyze vast datasets and harness AI advances,"" Lemke adds. Misinformation will no doubt persist in 2024, but experts say consumers will look more consciously toward wellness strategies backed by clinical studies and research. ""Consumers will expect science-based, performance-proven products and services,"" according to Mindbody and ClassPass's annual prediction report. In 2024, the report says, ""consumers will become increasingly savvy about what they put on their bodies and who they listen to for advice, prioritizing research and expertise."" Forecasters believe the same goes for wellness-focused social media. ""The increasing awareness of social media's negative effects on the mental health of young people is likely to lead to a more discerning approach to consuming mental health content online,"" says Nicholette Leanza, a licensed professional clinical counselor with mental health care company LifeStance Health. ""As a result, young people will likely shift their reliance on online content from non-credentialed influencers to licensed professionals for accurate diagnoses and effective counseling."" Whether it's in-person therapy sessions or participating in group sports, experts are seeing an increased desire for connection in the new year following years of pandemic-induced isolation that has taken a toll on our mental health. ""Social activities are appreciated on a greater level than before,"" says Bob Wright, director of lifestyle education at Hilton Head Health. ""Isolating increases baseline stress, and therefore baseline inflammation. It can also increase risk for anxiety, depression and other mental health related challenges. Many people got a dose of these isolating symptoms over recent years and are craving more opportunities for healthy socializing."" The huge popularity of pickleball is the perfect example of the desire for more social fitness, says Teddy Savage, national lead trainer at Planet Fitness. ""(It) brings people together in social settings that allow them to have fun while getting a full body workout,"" he says. ""It's the connection between exercise and functional movement and the desire to connect socially in community settings that make this one so magnetic."" Leanza has also seen an increasing demand for in-person therapy sessions, especially among Gen Z patients. ""This shift reflects a desire for more authentic and engaging therapeutic experiences, leveraging the benefits of face-to-face interactions ??I expect to see a continued uptick in this in 2024,"" she says.  Health trends with staying power ??like a focus on plant-based eating, sleep health and gut health ??point to a continued desire to live better for longer, which experts say will remain a priority in 2024. ""Some of the next trends we see will fall under the umbrellas of longevity and self-care,"" says David Chesworth, program director and exercise physiologist at Hilton Head Health. ""In general, the concept of longevity has been, and continues to be an overarching hot topic. In fact, many of the (previously mentioned) trends that have emerged over the past few years have been elevated by this."" In addition to nutrition and sleep, some people are turning to exercise to help them live longer. As Mindbody and ClassPass's report points out, ""nearly 30% of consumers say they exercise to live long and healthy lives and over one third of consumers strength train for longevity specifically."" Another necessary element of self-care and longevity? Rest and recovery, which Savage has also seen an increased focus on. ""This one really exploded with things like the cold plunge,"" he says. ""People are seeking out cutting edge ways to treat their body after working out or just diving deeper into the internal benefits of cold therapy and restorative techniques."" Temperature therapy is also a growing trend, according to Mindbody and ClassPass's report, which notes that the rise of combination treatments ??those that utilize both hot and cold ??is likely next in the pipeline.  Rest and recovery are even making their way into the travel industry with ""wellness tourism,"" the idea of travel focused on health and well-being. ""We see more people seeking out trips focused on things like yoga, breathing techniques, skill development, recreation, self-care, aging gracefully and incorporating joyful and stress-free activities,"" Chesworth says.

Kratom faces scrutiny over danger to consumers,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kratom-health-benefits-risks-death/,"Nearly 2 million Americans in 2021 used the herbal supplement Kratom to treat pain, anxiety and opioid withdrawal, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But the substance is also blamed for addiction, seizures and deaths ??like that of Dustin Hernandez. Hernandez's death was caught on security video, which showed him collapsing and having a seizure before he died. Toxicology testing by the medical examiner blamed the ""toxic effects of mitragynine,"" which is typically marketed as kratom. Hernandez's sister, Dusti Young, said her brother took kratom for his anxiety. ""He was in denial about it being addictive,"" she told CBS News. Kratom is commonly marketed as a wellness wonder, and is widely sold online and in gas stations. But the FDA says the substance is addictive and warns not to use kratom because of the ""risk of serious adverse effects."" The agency has been trying to bar kratom from being imported since 2014. ""Every bag of kratom on the shelf got here by people who are fraudulently saying it's something else,"" Talis Abolins, an attorney who represents Hernandez's family, said. ""What makes it even worse is that they're selling it like it's coffee or tea,"" Abolins added. The American Kratom Association admits there are many illegitimate kratom products. The group's spokesman, Mac Haddow, told CBS News that out of about 8,000 players in the kratom industry, only around ""three dozen"" are legitimate. Haddow blames the FDA. ""They simply say, 'We're not gonna regulate. We wanna ban it,'"" he said. ""They should be regulating and protecting consumers."" The American Kratom Association is pushing for the Kratom Consumer Protection Act, which it calls a best practices standard. Local versions of the act have already been passed in 11 states. But critics say the issue is kratom itself. ""This kratom product is associated with seizures, coma and death. And if that had been on the bag, a lot of lives would be saved,"" Abolins said.

Israel warns about Lebanon border hostilities as war in Gaza rages on,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-lebanon-border-hostilities-hezbollah-gaza-war/,"Israeli government minister Benny Gantz, one of three men who make up the country's emergency war cabinet, is threatening to intensify Israeli military action at the Israel-Lebanon border, where Hezbollah militants have been firing at northern Israel. ""I want to say to the world: The situation on the northern border requires a change,"" Gantz said at a press conference late Wednesday, adding that residents of border communities who have been evacuated due to the fighting there need to be returned to their homes. ""The hourglass for a political settlement is running out. If the world and Lebanon's government will not work to stop the shooting at Israel and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) will do so,"" Gantz said.

""We will operate to make the most of the diplomatic option,"" Cohen said. ""If it doesn't work, all options are on the table."" The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been firing rockets and artillery and sending drones over the Lebanese border with Israel in support of Hamas on a regular basis since the war began on October 7. Israel has also been firing into Lebanon, killing over 150 people there, mainly Hezbollah militants, according to the AFP news agency. At least 20 deaths have been civilians, and three of them have been journalists, AFP reports. On the Israeli side of the Lebanon border, at least nine soldiers and four civilians have been killed in hostilities, according to AFP. Meanwhile, Israeli forces bombed locations across Gaza overnight, killing dozens of people. Over 21,000 people have been killed so far in the hostilities there, according to the Hamas-run authority there, and 85% of the population has been displaced. Palestinians fleeing the expanded Israeli operations in central Gaza have filled up shelters near the border with Egypt, and the United Nations humanitarian office says the intense fighting in the enclave is impeding its ability to deliver aid.

U.S. officials meet with Mexican president amid record migrant crossings,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blinken-mayorkas-mexico-migrant-crisis/,"President Biden dispatched top officials to Mexico City this week for a meeting with President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador that the White House described as ""productive."" It came as migrants are crossing the U.S. border in record numbers and Congress has been unable to reach a consensus on funding border security. The White House National Security Council said in a statement Thursday that ""LÃ³pez Obrador has taken significant new enforcement actions yet we have a lot more work to do together,"" and that top White House officials will meet again with Mexican leaders in Washington in January. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Mr. Biden's homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall traveled to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with LÃ³pez Obrador. Senior Biden administration officials said late Wednesday that the meeting lasted over two hours. One senior administration official said that Mexico ""came prepared to share a plan with us on how they were taking the work that they are already doing"" to help stem the flow of migrants into the border. ""We have seen in recent days a pretty significant reduction in in border crossings,"" one of the officiasl said. ""So again, this is not something that the U.S. and Mexico will be able to address on or off on their own. So I would say the majority of our conversation actually focused on work that we're doing together in the region."" The senior administration officials said Mexico agreed on the need to crack down on smuggling. They also said Blinken and LÃ³pez Obrador discussed ""legal pathways"" for migrants, which one official described as one of the ""strong intersecting interests between President Biden and President LÃ³pez Obrador."" The meeting came as mayors of New York, Chicago and Denver said Wednesday that they have no more capacity for migrant arrivals, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has continued to send migrants to those cities. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Wednesday that all three cities ""have reached a point where we are either close to capacity, or nearly out of room."" ""Without significant intervention from the federal government, this mission will not be sustained,"" Johnson said.  In response to the mayors, White House spokesperson Angelo FernÃ¡ndez HernÃ¡ndez said in a statement that federal immigration clinics have provided assistance to roughly 10,000 migrants in applying for work permits. He he noted that Temporary Protected Status and work permit applications are being decided in 30 days on average. The White House said last week that Mr. Biden spoke to LÃ³pez Obradorabout ""ongoing efforts to manage migratory flows in the Western Hemisphere."" The two leaders ""agreed that additional enforcement actions are urgently needed so that key ports of entry can be reopened across our shared border,"" the White House said. The visit comes after Border Patrol processed nearly 50,000 migrants who entered the U.S. illegally in just five days last week. In November, Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 191,000 migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully. This month, as many as 10,000 migrants were apprehended daily at the southern border. Mexico's president said last week he's willing to help address the issue, but he wants the U.S. to provide more aid to the region and ease sanctions Cuba and Venezuela. ""We have always talked about addressing the causes [of migration]. The ideal thing is to help poor countries,"" LÃ³pez Obrador said, according to the Associated Press. In the U.S., Congress has debated border policy changes for weeks as part of a larger package including assistance to Ukraine and Israel. To convince Republicans ??who want harsher border security measures ??to support more foreign aid, Democrats are considering drastic limits on asylum and increased deportations.

Music producers push for legal protections against AI,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/music-producers-lawmakers-artificial-intelligence/,"Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming many aspects of daily life, including music and entertainment. The technology has prompted a significant push for stronger protections within the music industry, as AI companies face multiple lawsuits over alleged copyright infringement. Legendary music producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the creative geniuses behind many pop and R&B hits, are now speaking out about the challenges AI poses to the music industry. Their concerns stem from AI's ability to potentially replicate and manipulate artists' existing works without proper authorization. ""It's a new day. It's a new technology. Needs to be new rules,"" Lewis said. He said AI could take a song or a body of work and use it to create a song with all the data it has. ""So like. if all of a sudden someone took Janet [Jackson] and did a version of her voice and put it over a song,"" Jimmy Jam explained. ""If she said, 'Yes, that's fine' and she's participating in it, that's different than if somebody just takes it ... and right now there's really no regulation."" U.S. Senators Chris Coons and Marsha Blackburn are seeking to address these concerns by drafting the bipartisan ""No Fakes Act."" This proposed legislation aims to protect artists' voices and visual likenesses, holding individuals, companies and platforms accountable for replicating performances without permission. ""You've got to put some penalties on the books so that we can move forward productively,"" said Blackburn. Coons said, ""The No Fakes Act would take lessons from lots of existing state laws... and turn it into a national standard."" This comes in response to incidents like an unauthorized AI-generated song featuring Drake and The Weeknd, which gained millions of views before its removal.

"""Parasite"" actor Lee Sun-kyun found dead in South Korea, officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lee-sun-kyun-found-unconscious-local-media-reports-found-dead/,"Lee Sun-kyun, a popular South Korean actor best known for his role in the Oscar-winning movie ""Parasite,"" was found dead in a car in Seoul on Wednesday, authorities said, after weeks of an intense police investigation into his alleged drug use. The car was in a park, the Reuters news agency reported. Police and emergency officers initially found Lee in what they believed was an unconscious state in the car. Emergency officers later confirmed he was dead, according to Seoul's Seongbuk police station.  Police had been searching for Lee, 48, after receiving a report that he was missing, Seongbuk police said.   They refused to provide further details including whether they had determined Lee killed himself. But South Korean media outlets including the Yonhap news agency said Lee's family earlier Wednesday reported to police that he left home after writing a message similar to a suicide note. The talent agency that represented Lee, HODU&U Entertainment, didn't respond to calls from Reuters but Reuters says domestic media were pointing to an HODU&U statement expressing sadness over his death and urging restraint regarding false information, speculation, or malicious reports. Lee's body was later transported to a nearby Seoul hospital, according to Seongbuk police. Lee had undergone police probes into allegations that he used illegal drugs at the residence of a bar hostess. The investigation prompted extensive tabloid coverage. Lee insisted he was tricked into taking the drugs and that he did not know what he was taking, according to Yonhap. Reuters says he was questioned by police three times about the drug accusations, with one session running 19 hours over the weekend. The scandal led to the loss of a number of acting projects, Agence France-Presse reported. According to Reuters, a first-time conviction on drug use charges in South Korea can lead to six months in jail and up to 14 years for repeat offenders. South Korea's laws are so stringent that Koreans who take drugs legally while abroad can still face prosecution upon returning home, according to AFP. Lee appeared in ""Parasite,"" which won Oscars for best picture and three other categories in 2020. The class satire was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the then-92-year history of the Academy Awards, and was the first South Korean movie ever to win an Oscar. In the film, Lee played the head of a wealthy family. In 2021, he won a Screen Actors Guild award for ""cast in a motion picture"" for his role in the same film. He was nominated for best actor at the International Emmy Awards for his performance in the sci-fi thriller ""Dr. Brain"" last year, as well. Even before ""Parasite,"" Lee had been a popular actor in South Korea for a long time. He rose to stardom for his role in a hit TV drama series, ""Coffee Prince,"" in 2007,and gained mainstream popularity with the medical drama ""Behind The White Tower."" ""Pasta"" and ""My Mister.""",2023-12-28,"Lee Sun-kyun is best known for his role in the Oscar-winning movie ""Parasite"" He was found dead in a car in Seoul on Wednesday, authorities said.

Why scientists are hunting for the oldest ice in Antarctica,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/search-for-oldest-ever-ice-in-antarctica/,"They're braving some of the highest, driest, coldest and windiest conditions on the planet, but American scientists in Antarctica believe the effort is worth it. They're searching for a sample of the oldest ice ever found, which could help us better understand climate change.  The expedition to Antarctica is part of COLDEX, a federally funded collaboration of American universities and science organizations. For the team carrying out this work near the South Pole, it means camping on the ice without showers or flushing toilets for seven weeks. Once researchers collect ice samples, scientists back in the U.S. will examine them for information about what the climate was like hundreds of thousands of years ago.  ""The study of ice has shown us with extreme clarity what humans are doing to the Earth,"" Ed Brook, the director of COLDEX, said. As snow falls it traps in tiny air bubbles from the day it fell. The snow in Antarctica never melts because it's so cold. Ice builds up, layer upon layer, with all those air bubbles inside. Scientists then measure the levels of greenhouse gasses trapped inside those bubbles. That allows them to reconstruct how the climate changed in the distant past.   ""The information that we get, particularly from ice cores, is just so critical to our bedrock understanding of how Earth's climate works,"" Peter Neff, field research director for COLDEX, said.  The oldest existing ice core goes back 800,000 years. Scientists analyzed the ice cores over time, and they show that the amount of carbon dioxide, which is the big driver of climate change, goes up and down.  The level skyrocketed after the Industrial Revolution, then continued to get higher every year, which further warms our planet. COLDEX is funded by the National Science Foundation, which is the primary source of scientific research grants in the United States. The goal is to extend the continuous ice core record beyond 800,000 years ago to 1.5 million years ago, or even further, when the Earth was even warmer than it is now due to higher levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. ""We don't claim that by going back in time we're necessarily going to see something exactly like what we're seeing now,"" Brook said. ""What we're looking for are all the different ways the system can behave when it's warmer."" Identifying one spot on a massive continent that's likely to have 1.5 million years of perfectly preserved ice layers will take the COLDEX team several years. After the ice is identified, researchers will drill down from the surface to remove the cores. Transport requires climate-controlled packaging to make sure the ice doesn't melt in transit. The canisters first land in the U.S. in Colorado at the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility. If the mission is successful, that ice will make it back to university labs, including Princeton University, where COLDEX field researcher Sarah Shackleton works. ""I still get like very trapped up in the idea of, like, this little bubble used to be part of the atmosphere 4 million years ago, and then it like kind of got trapped up in the ice sheet, and now it's in New Jersey and we're measuring it,"" she said. American scientists aren't the only ones searching for the oldest ice. Teams from several other countries are also in Antarctica on their own missions with the same goal. European and Australian teams are drilling in different areas of the continent.  The team that discovers the ice first is likely to garner international attention for its work.

The James Webb Space Telescope's continued gifts,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-james-webb-space-telescopes-continued-gifts/,"The story of Christmas features a miraculous astronomical sight. But this Christmas, we're blessed with an abundance of new miraculous visions from the skies, courtesy of the James Webb Space Telescope, whichlifted off on Christmas Day two years ago ... from Jupiter and its rings (a mere 385 million miles away), to the Carina Nebula (7,500 light-years away), the Phantom Galaxy (32 million light-years away), and the deepest regions of space (13 billion light-years away). In 1989, NASA began thinking about a successor to the Hubble Telescope. The new machine would have massive gold-plated lenses that could detect infrared light ??invisible to our eyes, but capable of passing through dust and gases, 100 times farther into the universe. The Webb would also be much bigger than the Hubble: three stories tall and 70 feet wide, too big to fit into any existing rocket. NASA's solution? Fold it up. Scott Willoughby oversaw the Webb's construction at Northrup Grumman. Ten days before launch in 2021, he explained to ""Sunday Morning"" the complexity of the unfolding process: ""They have things that are called single-point failures ??this has to move this way, and there's only one of 'em. And Webb has over 300 of those."" Three hundred things that had to go exactly right.  It took almost seven months for the telescope to unfold, calibrate, and reach its orbit, a million miles from Earth. So now, on the second anniversary of the launch, we asked how it went.  ""It literally went perfect, as close to perfect as one could've even imagined,"" Willoughby said. ""People actually asked after, 'Did you overblow how hard this was?' And the truth was, practicing for everything as if it could go wrong was the best preparation for making it go right."" Because infrared is a form of heat, it had to get cold?”minus 400 degrees. Even the sun's heat would blind the telescope to the faint infrared signals from space. And so, a large sun shield ??an umbrella, basically ??was deployed to block out any shred of the sun's light from reaching the telescope's lenses. ""There's only one star in the entire universe we'll never see, and it's ours, it's the sun,"" Willoughby said.  Finally, the science could begin. At NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Jane Rigby, the Webb's chief scientist, talks to the telescope from the flight control room, drawing the data that has been collected. ""The elevator pitch for the Webb Telescope was to get the baby pictures of the universe,"" Rigby said. ""We have delivered exactly what we promised on that topic. We've gone from basically ignorance about what that first billion years of the universe was like, to having it in crisp high definition."" Another Webb mission: examining distant planets, to see if any of them have atmospheres like ours, maybe to find one human beings could live on. But how can a telescope know what's in a distant planet's atmosphere? Turns out, when a planet passes in front of its star, the elements of its atmosphere?”oxygen, nitrogen, whatever?”block specific bands of light. Analyzing how the spectrum of light changes can reveal what the atmosphere of that planet is like. The Webb has already studied the atmospheres of dozens of distant planets. On one, the exoplanet K2-18 b, it found carbon dioxide and methane, which suggests that it has oceans. [It's a mere 120 light-years from Earth.] Rigby said, ""It's such a joy that this telescope is working so well, because it was built really well by the engineers."" But not all the Webb headlines have been triumphant. One, in June 2022, didn't sound good at all: But Scott Willoughby was not worried: ""We designed the mirrors to get hit by micrometeorites ??you know, small particles, say grain of sand or something like that. But when you're truly talking about one small spot in something 22 feet across? The impact of it was really irrelevant. It actually didn't impact science at all."" But there were also some questions about the photos. Was NASA manipulating them? Colorizing them? NASA image experts Joe DePasquale said, ""That question actually comes up a lot: 'Is what Webb sees real?'""  He and Alyssa Pagan can answer questions about colorizing, because they're the ones who do it. ""It's our job to be able to translate that light into something that our eyes can see,"" DePasquale said. As it turns out, there's a lot of light that people can't see, like ultraviolet light, which bees can see; or infrared light, which pit vipers can see. Ultraviolet light travels in very short waves; infrared waves are much longer. And that's what guides the colorizing process. Pagan said, ""We're taking the shortest wavelengths, applying the bluer color; the middle wavelength, that's the green; and then the longest wavelength gets assigned the red. This is what we think is the truest representation of what we could possibly see, if we could see an infrared light."" In just the first year of Webb observations, scientists published more than 600 papers based on its discoveries. And according to Willoughby, the telescope has one more little gift for us this Christmas: ""When we launched, we never had to correct our own rocket engines,"" he said. ""We saved all of that fuel, and effectively on Day One, doubled the launch of the mission from ten years to 20."" So, for at least 20 years, scientists around the world will keep peeling back the mysteries of the universe, and the Webb will keep sending back pictures that amaze and amuse us, from the optical quirk known as the question mark?¦to the galaxy cluster that NASA calls the ""Christmas Tree,"" and beyond.

Scientists discover 5 furry hedgehog species with pointy snouts,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hedgehogs-new-species-smithsonian/,"They're small, furry and look like mice ??but scientists say they're actually a new species of hedgehogs. An international collaboration of researchers led by Smithsonian scientists identified five new species of soft-furred hedgehogs, according to a study published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. The scientists said they were able to use DNA analysis, as well as the animals' physical characteristics, to identify two entirely new species and elevate three hedgehog subspecies to the level of species. Distinguished by their furry bodies and pointy snouts, the little hedgehogs, known as lesser gymnures or Hylomys, are native to Southeast Asia. There were previously only two known species of the group ??now there are seven in total. Lead researcher Arlo Hinckley first became intrigued with identifying new hedgehog species during his postdoctoral work, according to a statement released by the Smithsonian. He worked with the museum's curator of animals,Melissa Hawkins, and other collaborators to assemble 232 physical specimens and 85 tissue samples for genetic analysis from across the entire Hylomys group, enabling them to identify these new species. Some of the samples were collected from field research ??which with small mammals can be extremely difficult. ""Imagine trying to follow a 10 cm animal around to watch their behavior,"" Hawkins told CBS News. Hinckley added, ""As most small mammals, they are elusive. They will generally hide in their burrows, under roots or in tall grass if you get close to them."" Researchers used museum specimens from the natural history collections of the Smithsonian and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia to fill in the gaps, the Smithsonian said. ""We were only able to identify these new hedgehogs thanks to museum staff that curated these specimens across countless decades and their original field collectors,"" Hinckley said in the statement. ""By applying modern genomic techniques like we did many years after these hedgehogs were first collected, the next generation will be able to identify even more new species."" The next, and most fun part, the researchers said, was naming the new species. ""This is the first time I get to name them and describe them from scratch, so it was very exciting!"" said Hinckley. The two new species names are H. macarong, after a Vietnamese word for vampire, due to the male's long, fang-like incisors, and H. vorax, after a description from of its behavior from mammalogist Frederick Ulmer, according to the news release. Hinckley said they ""had a brainstorming session in which we came up with several silly names for H. vorax.""  The three sub-species that were elevated are called H. dorsalis, H. maxi and H. peguensis. Researchers don't exactly know how many species are yet left to be discovered. ""For mammals, where there are around 6,500 currently described species,"" Hawkins said. Hinckley pointed toa 2018 studythat predicts ""7,342 mammalian species will be recognized by 2050 and 8,590 by 2100."" Identifying new species can help conservationists protect habitats as well as identify the sources of new diseases that could affect humans, the researchers said.

Idaho murders house being demolished today,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/university-of-idaho-murders-house-demolished/,"The house where four University of Idaho students were murdered last year is being torn down today. A delay in the trial of suspect Bryan Kohberger, originally set for October, had also delayed the demolition of the house on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, which had been given to the school earlier this year. Kohberger, 28, now expected toface trial next summerover the stabbing deaths of Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, and Xana Kernodle and her boyfriend Ethan Chapin, both 20. The university had announced that teams from both the prosecution and defense would have access to the six-bedroom house before its demolition, and the FBI had gathered additional information from the house in October. Neither the prosecution nor the defense have opposed demolition. Demolition was set for during the school's winter break, when fewer students would be in the area, according to the school. ""It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,"" university president Scott Green said in a statement released earlier this month. ""While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue."" Kaylee Goncalves' family, which has opposed the demolition, released a statement via their attorney Shanon Gray earlier this month, saying the house has evidentiary and emotional value and should not be demolished.  ""The family has stressed tirelessly to the Prosecution and the University of Idaho the importance (evidentiary and emotionally) that the King Road house carries but nobody seems to care enough,"" the family said in the statement, obtained by local station KREM. It's like screaming into a void. Nobody is listening and everyone tells you how sorry they are for the decision but the families' opinion isn't a priority. Victims' families have a voice and should be heard and listened to!"" The family of Ethan Chapin, who did not live at the house, offered its support for the demolition. ""We're supportive of the decision to take down the King Street House ??for the good of the University, its students (including our own kids), and the community of Moscow,"" family members said in a statement earlier this month. The four students were found stabbed to death in the rental home in November 2022. Two other roommates were unharmed. Kohberger, a graduate student in criminology at nearby Washington State University, was arrested the next month after a search that garnered national interest. He has pleaded not guilty. University spokeswoman Jodi Walker told The Associated Press it would take a few hours to raze the house and a few more to clear the site, depending on the weather. ""That is an area that is dense with students, and many students have to look at it and live with it every day and have expressed to us how much it will help with the healing process to have that house removed,"" she said.

"Jodi Hildebrandt, business partner of Ruby Franke, pleads guilty to child abuse",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jodi-hildebrandt-court-child-abuse-utah-therapist-ruby-franke/,"Jodi Hildebrandt, a therapist and the business partner of YouTube vlogger Ruby Franke, pleaded guilty to four counts of child abuse Wednesday in a Utah court. Hildebrandt was initially charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse for actions towards Franke's children. The charges are second-degree felonies that each carry a penalty of up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. As part of the plea deal, two of the charges were dropped. Hildebrandt pleaded guilty to four charges. The plea deal was signed on Dec. 23, according to documents reviewed by CBS News. This comes nine days after Franke also plead guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. As part of herplea agreement, Franke was set to testify against Hildebrandt. Hildebrandt owned a counseling business that she says teaches people to improve their lives, while Franke operated the now-defunct ""8 Passengers"" channel detailing her life with her husband and six children. Franke appeared in several of Hildebrandt's videos, and the two were business partners. In August, one of Franke's children fled Hildebrandt's Utah home, malnourished and injured, and asked another neighbor for food and water. The neighbor called the police.  Police said they found the child emaciated, with duct tape around his wrists and ankles. Court documents revealed that the boy said Hildebrandt had put the restraints on him, then used cayenne pepper and honey to treat the wounds. One of Franke's daughters was also found at Hildebrandt's house. Franke and Hildebrandt were both arrested on Aug. 30. A YouTube video from Hildebrandt's channel featuring Franke was also referenced in court documents, according to KUTV. The video showed Franke in Hildebrandt's home two days before the arrest, which served as evidence that the women were ""present in the home and having knowledge of the abuse, malnourishment, and neglect"" of the children. Franke was also charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse, but two of those charges were dropped as part of her plea deal. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 20, 2024. Hildebrandt's sentencing date has not been publicly confirmed. Hildebrandt pleaded guilty to four charges of aggravated child abuse, and, like Franke's plea, the agreement includes details of crimes that are described as the ""physical torture"" of two children. The agreement states that Hildebrandt either carried out the torture or allowed it to be inflicted on the children. According to the agreement, two of Franke's children were made to do physical labor like wall sits and outdoor work without shoes in the summer. Both were made to spend several days outside, the agreement said, which resulted in serious sunburns. The children were denied food and water or fed only plain, insufficient foods. Franke's now 12-year-old son tried to escape Hildebrandt's house on one occasion before the escape in August when he made it to a neighbor's house. After the initial escape attempt, which took place in July, he was bound with rope and handcuffs, the agreement states. The wounds from his injuries were treated with ""homeopathic remedies"" and covered in duct tape, according to the plea. During outdoor work, Franke's 9-year-old daughter sustained injuries and burns to her feet while walking barefoot. Hildebrandt also ""either physically forced or coerced"" the daughter to ""jump into a cactus multiple times.""  Both children, the agreement states, were told they were possessed and that the abuse was a result of their disobedience. They were also indoctrinated to believe the abuse was a form of repentance for their actions, according to the agreement. Kerry Breen is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

6 exciting space missions set to launch in 2024,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/space-missions-launch-2024-artemis-clipper-viper-moon-mars/,"Ali M. Bramsonis an assistant professor of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences atPurdue University. The year 2023 proved to be an important one for space missions, with NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission returning a sample from an asteroid and India's Chandrayaan-3 mission exploring the lunar south pole, and 2024 is shaping up to be another exciting year for space exploration. Several new missions under NASA's Artemis plan and Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative will target the moon. The latter half of the year will feature several exciting launches, with the launch of the Martian Moons eXploration mission in September, Europa Clipper and Hera in October and Artemis II and VIPER to the Moon in November ??if everything goes as planned. I'm a planetary scientist, and here are six of the space missions I'm most excited to follow in 2024. NASA will launch Europa Clipper, which will explore one of Jupiter's largest moons, Europa. Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, with a surface made of ice. Beneath its icy shell, Europa likely harbors a saltwater ocean, which scientists expect contains over twice as much water as all the oceans here on Earth combined. With Europa Clipper, scientists want to investigate whether Europa's ocean could be a suitable habitat for extraterrestrial life. The mission plans to do this by flying past Europa nearly 50 times to study the moon's icy shell, its surface's geology and its subsurface ocean. The mission will also look for active geysers spewing out from Europa. This mission will change the game for scientists hoping to understand ocean worlds like Europa.  The launch window ??the period when the mission could launch and achieve its planned route ??opens Oct. 10, 2024, and lasts 21 days. The spacecraft will launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket and arrive at the Jupiter system in 2030. The Artemis program, named after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology, is NASA's plan to go back to the moon. It will send humans to the moon for the first time since 1972, including the first woman and the first person of color. Artemis also includes plans for a longer-term, sustained presence in space that will prepare NASA for eventually sending people even farther ??to Mars. Artemis II is the first crewed step in this plan, with four astronauts planned to be on board during the 10-day mission. The mission builds upon Artemis I, which sent an uncrewed capsule into orbit around the moon in late 2022. Artemis II will put the astronauts into orbit around the moon before returning them home. It is currently planned for launch as early as November 2024. But there is a chance it will get pushed back to 2025, depending on whether all the necessary gear, such as spacesuits and oxygen equipment, is ready. VIPER, which stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, is a robot the size of a golf cart that NASA will use to explore the moon's south pole in late 2024.  Originally scheduled for launch in 2023, NASA pushed the mission back to complete more tests on the lander system, which Astrobotic, a private company, developed as part of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. This robotic mission is designed to search for volatiles, which are molecules that easily vaporize, like water and carbon dioxide, at lunar temperatures. These materials could provide resources for future human exploration on the moon. The VIPER robot will rely on batteries, heat pipes and radiators throughout its 100-day mission, as it navigates everything from the extreme heat of lunar daylight ??when temperatures can reach 224 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) ??to the moon's frigid shadowed regions that can reach a mind-boggling -400 F (-240 C). VIPER's launch and delivery to the lunar surface is scheduled for November 2024. NASA has recently invested in a class of small, low-cost planetary missions called SIMPLEx, which stands for Small, Innovative Missions for PLanetary Exploration. These missions save costs by tagging along on other launches as what is called a rideshare, or secondary payload.  One example is the Lunar Trailblazer. Like VIPER, Lunar Trailblazer will look for water on the moon.  But while VIPER will land on the Moon's surface, studying a specific area near the south pole in detail, Lunar Trailblazer will orbit the moon, measuring the temperature of the surface and mapping out the locations of water molecules across the globe.  Currently, Lunar Trailblazer is on track to be ready by early 2024. However, because it is a secondary payload, Lunar Trailblazer's launch timing depends on the primary payload's launch readiness. The PRIME-1 mission, scheduled for a mid-2024 launch, is Lunar Trailblazer's ride. PRIME-1 will drill into the moon ??it's a test run for the kind of drill that VIPER will use. But its launch date will likely depend on whether earlier launches go on time.  An earlier Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission with the same landing partner was pushed back to February 2024 at the earliest, and further delays could push back PRIME-1 and Lunar Trailblazer. While Earth's moon has many visitors ??big and small, robotic and crewed ??planned for 2024, Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos will soon be getting a visitor as well. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, has a robotic mission in development called the Martian Moon eXploration, or MMX, planned for launch around September 2024.  The mission's main science objective is to determine the origin of Mars' moons. Scientists aren't sure whether Phobos and Deimos are former asteroids that Mars captured into orbit with its gravity or if they formed out of debris that was already in orbit around Mars. The spacecraft will spend three years around Mars conducting science operations to observe Phobos and Deimos. MMX will also land on Phobos' surface and collect a sample before returning to Earth.  Hera is a mission by the European Space Agency to return to the Didymos-Dimorphos asteroid system that NASA's DART mission visited in 2022. But DART didn't just visit these asteroids, it collided with one of them to test a planetary defense technique called ""kinetic impact."" DART hit Dimorphos with such force that it actually changed its orbit. The kinetic impact technique smashes something into an object in order to alter its path. This could prove useful if humanity ever finds a potentially hazardous object on a collision course with Earth and needs to redirect it. Hera will launch in October 2024, making its way in late 2026 to Didymos and Dimorphos, where it will study physical properties of the asteroids.

"When and where to see tonight's Cold Moon, last full moon of 2023",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-and-where-to-see-the-cold-moon-the-longest-and-last-full-moon-of-2023/,"The longest ??and last ??full moon of the year appeared on Monday night and will peak on Tuesday. December's full moon, also known as the Cold Moon and Long Night Moon, will reach peak illumination at 7:33 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to NASA. It will look like a full moon until Thursday morning. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the United States. To view the full moon, it's not rocket science: NASA recommends going outside and looking upat the sky. Using a telescope or binocularswill magnify the moon and clarify details on its surface. Local forecasts have detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in different locations where people are keeping an eye out for the moon. December's full moon gets its Cold Moon moniker from Mohawk traditions, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is based on the frigid conditions of the time of year. The full moon is also called the Long Night Moon because December's full moon occurs near the winter solstice, which has the longest night of the year. This year's solstice was on Dec. 21. ""The full moon takes a high trajectory across the sky because it is opposite to the low sun, so the moon will be above the horizon longer than at other times of the year,"" according to NASA. Other names for December's full moon include Drift Clearing Moon, Frost Exploding Trees Moon, Moon of the Popping Trees, Hoar Frost Moon, Snow Moon, Winter Maker Moon, Moon When the Deer Shed Their Antlers and Little Spirit Moon, according to the Farmer's Almanac. Ancient pagans in Europe called the December full Moon the Moon Before Yule. ""No matter the name, we're a big fan,"" NASA said Tuesday on one of its social media accounts. Next month's full moon is dubbed the Wolf Moon. It will peak on Jan. 25. December's full moon does fall on Christmas sometimes, but it's a rare occasion. The last full moon to peak on Christmas was in 2015. Before that, there hadn't been one since 1977. Astronomers say the next Christmas full moon won't be until 2034.

"When and where to see the Ursids, last meteor shower to peak in 2023",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ursids-meteor-shower-peak-2023-nasa/,"The Ursids meteor shower is set to peak Thursday night into Friday morning, according to the American Meteor Society. The cosmic show, which will be the last meteor shower to peak in 2023, radiates from the constellation Ursa Minor, also known as the Little Dipper, according to NASA. The space agency has described the Ursids as ""a meteor shower for diehards only, especially with chilly winter temperatures for observers in much of the Northern Hemisphere!!"" Here's what you should know about the Ursids meteor shower, including its causes: The Ursids are visible across the night sky. Meteor showers are best viewed at night and in the pre-dawn hours. NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas that are well away from city and street lights. Astronomy fans should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south and look up. It takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark so that you can see the meteors. Viewers should make sure to bundle up and keep warm while watching for the Ursids. Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere, according to NASA. They heat up as they fall toward Earth and appear as shooting stars. The streaks of light we see come from glowing, hot air as meteors speed through Earth's atmosphere. While meteors streak through the sky every night, there are several meteor showers each year. During meteor showers, many meteors hit Earth's atmosphere in a short period of time. Most of the meteors burn up in space. The few that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere and reach the ground are considered meteorites. NASA said astronomy fans should not expect to find meteorites after a meteor shower. Most meteors appear to be colorless or white, Bill Cooke, head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, said in a NASA blog post. The next meteor shower, the Quadrantids, is set to peak in early January. The Quadrantids are active from Dec. 26, 2023, to Jan. 16, 2024. After the Ursids and the Quadrantids, another meteor shower won't happen for months. Aliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.

"""Christmas tree cluster"" found glowing green in space",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-discovers-cosmic-christmas-tree-cluster-glowing-in-space/,"Your living room isn't the only place housing a large green Christmas tree with sparkling lights this year. NASA has found a spot in space with its own glowing cosmic tree for the holiday season. The object in question is named NGC 2264, otherwise known as the ""Christmas Tree Cluster,"" and is a formation of young stars ??some of which are larger than the sun ??between the ages of 1 and 5 million years old. NASA says the cluster lies in the Milky Way, roughly 2,500 light-years from Earth. ""It's beginning to look a like cosmos,"" NASA joked in a tweet about the cluster. It's beginning to look a lot like cosmos. ?Ž¶Our @ChandraXray Observatory recently spotted the blue-and-white lights that decorate the ""Christmas Tree Cluster,"" a swarm of stars and gas some 2,500 light-years from Earth: https://t.co/VT2WaLgp77 pic.twitter.com/HrnrmxRyd7 A composite image of the star cluster makes NGC 2264 look like a Christmas tree, NASA said, with a bright green glow and what looks like blue and white sparkling lights. But rather than being pine needles and string lights, the green glow is actually gas, while the blue and white sparkles are young stars emitting X-rays. The blue and white dots aren't blinking in sync as depicted in the composite, NASA said, and were coordinated as such ""to emphasize the locations of the stars...and highlight the similarity of this object to a Christmas tree."" NASA announced the new image just weeks after the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope revealed their own holiday discovery ??a ""Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster"" roughly 4.3 billion light-years from Earth that's one of the most detailed views of the universe ever depicted. ""We're calling MACS0416 the Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster, both because it's so colorful and because of these flickering lights we find within it,"" said astronomer Haojing Yan, one of the study authors. ""We can see transients everywhere."" The cluster image is among ""unprecedented"" deep views of the universe, and includes a visual of an ancient star nicknamed ""Mothra"" that is believed to have existed 11 billion years ago ??long before the sun in our solar system formed.

Notable Deaths in 2023,https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/notable-deaths-in-2023/,"A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity. By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery. Ryan O'Neal (April 20, 1941-December 8, 2023) transitioned from an actor on TV's ""Peyton Place"" to an Oscar-nominated role in ""Love Story,"" the blockbuster tear-jerker that catapulted him into the front ranks of Hollywood stars in the 1970s. O'Neal and Ali MacGraw starred as college students from disparate backgrounds who fall in love, marry, and then discover she is dying of cancer. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Appearing in a wide range of comedies and dramas, O'Neal cleverly used his boyish good looks to play men who hid sinister backgrounds behind clean-cut images. He starred in Stanley Kubrick's historical epic ""Barry Lyndon,"" playing a roguish opportunist whose life cascades between poverty and wealth, from the battlefields of Europe to an aristocratic estate. O'Neal's gift for comedy shone opposite Barbra Streisand in Peter Bogdanovich's ""What's Up, Doc?""; and he shared the screen with his daughter, Tatum, as a pair of confidence tricksters in ""Paper Moon,"" for which the 10-year-old won an Oscar for best supporting actress.  His other film credits included ""The Big Bounce"" (in which he appeared with his second wife, Leigh Taylor-Young), ""Wild Rovers,"" ""Nickelodeon,"" ""A Bridge Too Far,"" ""The Driver,"" ""Oliver's Story"" (a poorly-received sequel to ""Love Story""), ""The Main Event,"" ""Irreconcilable Differences,"" ""Tough Guys Don't Dance,"" and ""Knight of Cups."" O'Neal continued acting into his 70s, appearing on TV's ""90210,"" ""Bull,"" ""Bones,"" ""Malibu's Most Wanted,"" and ""Desperate Housewives."" Talented but troubled, O'Neal's boy-next-door image was sometimes at odds with his personal life, marked by a hot temper, drugs and alcohol. Twice divorced, he had strained relationships with three of his four children. In her autobiography Tatum O'Neal wrote of suffering physical and emotional abuse from her dad. They tried to patch things up by participating in a reality TV series, ""Ryan and Tatum: The O'Neals."" In 2007 Ryan was arrested for firing a gun at his son Griffin, but charges were dropped. The following year, he was arrested along with his son Redmond on drug charges. In 2009 he told Vanity Fair magazine, ""I'm a hopeless father. I don't know why. I don't think I was supposed to be a father."" The one constant in his life was Farrah Fawcett. Their relationship was an on-again/off-again affair, which was rekindled in 2001, when O'Neal was diagnosed with leukemia; Fawcett was at his side. Five years later, when Fawcett was diagnosed with cancer, he was there for her until the end, when she died in 2009. He even suggested that the hospital chaplain marry the two. ""She said, 'Okay, let's get married,'""O'Neal told ""CBS This Morning"" in 2012. ""But by then, she was so weak that he was only able to give her the last rites."" In 2021, O'Neal and MacGraw spoke with ""Sunday Morning"" about the making of ""Love Story,"" and noted that over the years they'd been asked frequently to explain the movie's most famous quote: ""Love means never having to say you're sorry."" ""Neither of us knew at the time,"" said O'Neal. ""But over the years, we have come up with answers that ??I don't know. I had to say 'I'm sorry' a lot in my life, that's all I know!""",2023-12-28,"O'Neal and MacGraw spoke with ""Sunday Morning"" about the making of ""Love Story"" O'Neal continued acting into his 70s, appearing on TV's ""90210"" and ""Bull"""
