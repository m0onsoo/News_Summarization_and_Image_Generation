B-1 bomber crashes while trying to land at its base in South Dakota,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/b-1-bomber-crash-landing-ellsworth-air-force-base-south-dakota-crew-ejected/,"Washington — A B-1 Lancer bomber from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota crashed Thursday, and all four of its crew members ejected, the Air Force said. The B-1 crashed ""at approximately 5:50 p.m. today while attempting to land on the installation. At the time of the accident, it was on a training mission. There were four aircrew on board. All four ejected safely,"" the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth said in a statement. At the time of the crash, visibility was poor with freezing temperatures and low clouds, according to automated weather reporting equipment recording airfield conditions.  The B-1 is a conventional supersonic bomber that first came into service in the 1980s. It's been used to support the U.S. bomber presence in the Asia-Pacific region and to conduct close air support missions in U.S. operations in Afghanistan. It doesn't carry nuclear weapons.  While 100 were originally built, fewer than 60 remain in service, at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and Ellsworth Air Force Base.

"As gun violence increases, active shooter defense industry booms",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/active-shooter-defense-industry-safedefend/,"A 6th grader was killed and five others were injured in a shooting at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa, on Thursday. American schools are expected to spend $3.5 billion on security this year, according to the research firm Omdia, part of a growing trend in spending on defense against active shooters. Greg Vecchi, director of research and training at SafeDefend, says the company's technology can help people survive a shooting at schools and workplaces. ""Think of it as the fire alarm for active killers,"" he told CBS News. In 2014, a gunman opened fire in the parking lot of a Jewish Community Center in Overland Park, Kansas, killing a man, his grandson and a third person who was nearby. ""To come in the building and see bullet holes, glass shattered, definitely an immediate loss of security,"" said Sandra Greason, an employee at the center. Since then, the center has installed license plate readers, more cameras, armed guards, metal detectors, and now, SafeDefend devices. The technology was created by Jeff Green, who left his job as an elementary school principal to work on it. ""No matter how much law enforcement wants to be there, there's a gap,"" Green said. ""There's a time when we're on our own. And how do we survive until help arrives?"" Greason told CBS the center's new safety measures, which also include active shooter training, make her feel more secure. ""Preparedness is key, right? The more you're prepared, the better you feel and the more confident you feel,"" she said. SafeDefend is just one part of what's become a booming industry aimed at protecting kids and employees from a rapid rise in mass shootings. Products range from gun detectors guided by artificial intelligence to bulletproof tables and automatically locking doors. Odis Johnson Jr., executive director at Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, is skeptical these products are the answer to gun violence. ""We've seen year-over-year increases in death and injury,"" he said. ""We really do need a more comprehensive approach that includes gun safety and stiffer regulations for gun ownership,"" Johnson added.",2024-01-05,"American schools are expected to spend $3.5 billion on security this year.

Alaska's snow crab season canceled for second year in a row,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-snow-crab-season-canceled-2024/,"Gabriel Prout is grateful for a modest haul of king crab, but it's the vanishing of another crustacean variety that has the fishing port in Kodiak, Alaska, bracing for financial fallout; for the second year in a row, the lucrative snow crab seasonhas been canceled. ""We're still definitely in survival mode trying to find a way to stay in business,"" he told CBS News. When the season was canceled last year, there was a sense of confusion among the Alaska crab fisher community. Now, a sense of panic is taking hold in the state's fisheries, which produce 60% of the nation's seafood. ""It's just still extremely difficult to fathom how we could go from a healthy population in the Bering Sea to two closures in a row,"" Prout said. And while he is barely holding on, others — like Joshua Songstad — have lost almost everything. ""All of a sudden, now I'm at home with no income and really not much to do,"" Songstad said. The crisis first began in early 2022, after biologists discovered an estimated 10 billion crabs disappeared — a 90% plunge in the population. ""The first reaction was, is this real? You know, we looked at it and it was almost a flat line,"" said Ben Daly, a research coordinator with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. A recent survey of the species showed little sign of a rebound. ""Environmental conditions are changing rapidly,"" Daly told CBS News last year when the snow crab season was canceled for the first time ever. ""We've seen warm conditions in the Bering Sea the last couple of years, and we're seeing a response in a cold-adapted species, so it's pretty obvious this is connected. It is a canary in a coal mine for other species that need cold water.""   According to new research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a marine heat wave linked to climate change impacted the snow crabs' food supply and drove them to starvation. Biologists hope this second round of suspensions will give the remaining snow crab population time to bulk back up. But with the climate threat only growing, there's concern the snow crabs, along with the industry that depends on them, will continue to shrink. ""I'm a fourth-generation fisherman,"" Songstad said. ""I would like to say that this is gonna be here for my kids, but the reality is we're a dying breed and if we keep going the way we're going, there's not going to be any of us left.""

New Microsoft PC button will be its 1st major keyboard change in decades,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-adding-copilot-pc-button-keyboard-change-ai/,"Microsoft is adding an artificial intelligence button to its Windows keyboards in a move that marks the company's first significant keyboard change in nearly three decades. The button — called the Copilot key — will launch Microsoft's AI chatbot, the company's executive vice president Yusuf Mehdi wrote in the Thursday announcement. He said Microsoft sees the key addition as ""the entry point into the world of AI on the PC."" ""We believe it will empower people to participate in the AI transformation more easily,"" Mehdi wrote. Copilot, announced in March of last year, integrates AI into Microsoft's software. The tool is integrated with Microsoft 365 and works alongside Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams. Users can currently access it with the keyboard shortcut Windows + C. Mehdi wrote that the additional key will move the technology world closer to a future where AI is ""seamlessly"" woven into Windows, from the system to the hardware. ""This will not only simplify people's computing experience but also amplify it, making 2024 the year of the AI PC,"" Mehdi wrote. Starting this month, some new PCs running Windows 11 will have the Copilot keyboard button. The key will also be included on some upcoming Surface devices. Microsoft did not specify which computer manufacturers would be adding the button, only saying the key would be on ""many of the new Windows 11 PCs from our ecosystem partners."" Dell Technologies on Thursday said the Copilot key would be on its newest XPS laptops. If Copilot is not available or enabled on the device, pressing the key will launch Windows' search function instead. Microsoft compared the new button to the Windows key, which was introduced nearly 30 years ago. The new button, featuring the Copilot logo, will be located near the keyboard's space bar. The QWERTY layout, which comprises the bulk of the modern keyboard, was developed in the 1870s. Aliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.

NYC train collision causes subway derailment; 24 injured,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/incident-near-96th-street-disrupts-subway-service-on-123-lines-mta-says/,"NEW YORK -- Asubwaycollision caused two trains to derail Thursday afternoon in Manhattan, the MTA said. The accident happened at around 3 p.m. near 96th Street and Broadway on the Upper West Side. The FDNY said 24 people suffered non-life threatening injuries.   Both subways were 1 trains, NYC Transit President Richard Davey said. One of the trains had 300 passengers on board at the time of the crash. The other was out of service after having been vandalized, officials said. The NYPD said two transit K-9 officers assigned to the station were alerted by a good Samaritan when the collision first happened. ""They rendered aid, again requested ems to respond to the scene, and then those officers, along with additional officers, that responded helped people off the trains and onto the platforms to safety,"" NYPD Chief of Transit Michael Kemper said. The FDNY tweeted images showing one of the trains as emergency crews rushed in. What passengers saw as they exited the train left them speechless. ""The floors were all crunched up. The seats were really bad. They didn't even look like seats no more. The poles were all bent,"" one said. Officials said the impact injured two dozen people. ""I hit my head against the window. People were getting hurt, basically,"" a passenger said. ""Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured. The injuries that were sustained were consistent with a low-speed train derailment,"" FDNY Deputy Chief Ian Swords said. ""The trains, literally, at slow speed, thankfully, bumped into each other just north of the station. We were able to evacuate a number of our customers,"" Davey said. ""Thankfully, there were no serious injuries. Obviously, two trains should not be bumping into one another. We're going to get to the bottom of that. What we do know is that the out-of-service train had been vandalized. A number of emergency cords had been pulled earlier by someone. They were able to reset all of them except one, and that was the reason why that train was still stuck in the station."" ""The train started shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking, very hard,"" one passenger said. ""Everyone was scared, screaming. There was a lot of children. Everyone was trying to call 911."" ""All of a sudden, we just felt, like, a loud boom. Everybody on the train kind of, like, swayed back and forth crazily, and there was a loud explosion. And all of the sudden, the train stopped, kind of, smoke was coming into the car. It was insane. It was super nerve-wracking,"" a passenger said. ""I thought the concrete on top of the train was going to fall in. I thought the subway was going to fall in on us,"" commuter Gregory King added. Emergency responders requested the MTA switch the power off, and then they were able to evacuate the train that had passengers on it. Davey said the out-of-service train was being operated from the middle of the train, from the conductor position, although there was a train operator at the front of the train and two other employees on board as well. ""At the end of the day, thankfully, this was low speed. We'll get to the bottom of this, and make sure that whatever occurred doesn't happen again,"" Davey said. Transit officials said it will take some time before service is back up and running. A lot of work needs to be done during the overnight hours. ""We have crews down there now, I expect will be out there all night. And my hope is we will have service restored tomorrow for rush hour. But I cannot guarantee that,"" Davey said. There was partial service Thursday night following suspensions on the 1, 2 and 3 lines, and changes to some 4 and 5 trains. ""I might have to walk a few blocks up and to Columbus Circle and see. Maybe I can catch another train there,"" said Hadi Soussi of Long Island City. Passengers on their way home from work, school, or simply running errands had no idea they would be dealing with this level of subway disruptions. A trip to the doctor cost Jerry Stevens a pretty penny. ""I had to catch a yellow cab that cost me $60 to get there. Now I gotta go to Queens to get my medicine,"" Stevens said. ""It happens. It's life. It's something you gotta go through living in New York City,"" added Shawn Reid of Pelham Parkway. Some commuters were already planning ahead. ""Tomorrow, I'm gonna take the bus because definitely I can't do the train,"" said Cristina Garcia of the Upper West Side. An MTA press briefing is planned for 8:30 a.m. on Friday to discuss derailment and service changes. In the meantime, customers are being asked to check the MTA website or the MTA app for updates.",2024-01-05,"""I thought the concrete on top of the train was going to fall in.

Terminally ill Connecticut woman ends her life in Vermont,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lynda-bluestein-terminally-ill-connecticut-woman-ends-life-vermont/,"A Connecticut woman who pushed for expanded access to Vermont's lawthat allows people who are terminally ill to receive lethal medication to end their lives died in Vermont on Thursday, an event her husband called ""comfortable and peaceful,"" just like she wanted. Lynda Bluestein, who had terminal cancer, ended her life by taking prescribed medication. Her last words were 'I'm so happy I don't have to do this (suffer) anymore,'"" her husband Paul wrote in an email on Thursday to the group Compassion & Choices, which was shared with The Associated Press. The organization filed a lawsuit against Vermont in 2022 on behalf of Bluestein, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Diana Barnard, a physician from Middlebury. The suit claimed Vermont's residency requirement in its so-called patient choice and control at end-of-life law violated the U.S. Constitution's commerce, equal protection, and privileges and immunities clauses. The state agreed to a settlement last March that allowed Bluestein, who is not a Vermont resident, to use the law to die in Vermont. And two months later, Vermont made such accommodations available to anyone in similar circumstances, becoming the first state in the country to change its law to allow terminally ill people from out of state to take advantage of it to end their lives. Ten states allow medically assisted suicide but before Vermont changed its law only one state - Oregon - allowed non-residents to do it, by not enforcing the residency requirement as part of a court settlement. Oregon went on to remove that requirement this past summer. Vermont's law, in effect since 2013, allows physicians to prescribe lethal medication to people with an incurable illness that is expected to kill them within six months. Supporters say the law has stringent safeguards, including a requirement that those who seek to use it be capable of making and communicating their healthcare decision to a physician. Patients are required to make two requests orally to the physician over a certain timeframe and then submit a written request, signed in the presence of two or more witnesses who aren't interested parties. The witnesses must sign and affirm that patients appeared to understand the nature of the document and were free from duress or undue influence at the time. Others express moral opposition to assisted suicide and say there are no safeguards to protect vulnerable patients from coercion. Bluestein, a lifelong activist, who pushed for similar legislation to be passed in Connecticut and New York, which has not happened, wanted to make sure she didn't die like her mother, in a hospital bed after a prolonged illness. She told The Associated Press last year that she wanted to die surrounded by her husband, children, grandchildren, wonderful neighbors, friends and dog. ""I wanted to have a death that was meaningful, but that it didn't take forever ... for me to die,"" she said. ""I want to live the way I always have, and I want my death to be in keeping with the way I wanted my life to be always,"" Bluestein said. ""I wanted to have agency over when cancer had taken so much for me that I could no longer bear it. That's my choice.""

Peloton shares jump as it partners with TikTok on fitness content,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-peloton-fitness-app/,"Peloton Interactive and TikTok are teaming to develop fitness content, the exercise equipment maker and social platform said Thursday. The partnership marks the first time that Peloton will produce custom social content for use outside its own network, according to to the New York company and China's TikTok said. The co-branded hub, which will be available in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., will show dedicated Peloton content, including live classes and celebrity collaborations. The deal comes six months into a rebranding effort by Peloton, which last year launched a tiered pricing strategy for its app as it tries to broaden its audience beyond customers willing and able to buy its costly fitness equipment. Peloton's stock price leapt more than 15% following the announcement and closed 14% higher at $6.13 per share. Still, the company's standing on Wall Street is a far cry from 2020, when its shares hit more than $160, taking a precipitous drop since then and tanking more than 20% in the last year alone. Peloton enjoyed strong consumer demand for its stationary bikes and treadmills during the pandemic, but that appetite dissipated as the virus faded and people returned to the gym or took up other hobbies.

Casual restaurant chain TGI Fridays is closing 36 ""underperforming"" locations across the U.S. as part of a corporate growth strategy, the company said in astatementWednesday. The privately owned company will also sell eight corporate-owned restaurants to TGI Fridays' former CEO Ray Blanchette, who had served as chief executive until last year, the company said. Some employees at affected restaurants will have the opportunity to move to roles at other locations. The chain said more than 1,000 workers, or more than 80% of employees working at restaurants that are closing, will be offered transfer opportunities. Roughly 1,250 workers will be affected by the restaurant closures, which are concentrated in Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Virginia.

How much money do college and university presidents make?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-much-do-university-presidents-make/,"College and university presidents hold some of the loftiest positions in academia, with lofty salaries to match. While many were previously employed as scholars and professors, in their role as leader of a university they are more akin to a CEO overseeing a company than to academics pursuing scholarly research or lecturing. A big part of the job often includes networking and fundraising, in addition to setting academic policies and defining the curriculum. In addition to demonstrated leadership, financial and business acumen are often cited as required characteristics of a college president. FormerHarvard University President Claudine Gay, who announced her resignation after hercontroversial testimonyat a Capitol Hill hearing on antisemitism on college campuses, and amid allegations of plagiarism, will continue to serve as a member of the university's faculty. Prior to serving as university president, Gay earned a salary of nearly $880,000 in her last year as Dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a position she held from 2018 to 2021, according to theHarvard Crimson. It's unclear how much Gay will earn in her downsized role at Harvard, or how much she'll be compensated for her six months in the role of president.  Gay's predecessor as president of Harvard, Lawrence S. Bacow, earned more than $1.3 million in 2021, according to the student newspaper. Harvard did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for information about Gay's compensation. The most selective schools in the U.S. don't necessarily pay their presidents the most. The president of Thomas Jefferson University was the best-paid private college president in the country, making a total of more than $8.4 million in 2020, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. Both his base pay and total compensation exceed that of other private college presidents. The outlet compiled the list based on the Internal Revenue Service's Form 990 for tax-exempt organizations. A university president's total compensation reflects their base pay, bonus, health and other benefits, as well as any other compensation, which can include housing expenses, club dues and more. With an acceptance rate of 87%, Thomas Jefferson University is ranked No. 142 in the ""National Universities"" category by U.S. News and World Report. By contrast, Christopher Eisgruber, president of No. 1 ranked Princeton University, makes just over $1 million a year. These were the top-earning private college presidents in 2020, along with their annual comp, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education: Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, was the highest-paid president of an Ivy League school, earning $2.6 million annually. In 2022, the top-earning public college presidents included: Not all college presidencies are as lucrative. Nationwide, university presidents earn an average of $186,961 annually, according to ZipRecruiter, an online employment marketplace. Other university president roles advertise pay as low as $32,274, according to the site. Other, less prestigious colleges and universities are also conducting searches for new presidents. On the online job board Indeed, Marwood University, a private Catholic university in Scranton, Pennsylvania, is recruiting a president, with base pay for the position starting at $325,000 a year.

"2 indicted in Airbnb, Vrbo scam linked to 10,000 reservations",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/airbnb-vrbo-scam-linked-to-10000-reservations-across-10-states-shray-goel-shaunik-raheja/,"Two men were indicted by a federal grand jury as the masterminds behind a vast online rental properties scam that raked in more than $8.5 million, and was linked to 10,000 reservations across 10 states, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday. Shray Goel, 35, of Miami, and Shaunik Raheja, 34, of Denver, operated a short-term house rental business used to defraud Airbnb, Vrbo and guests renting properties through those platforms, according to the indictment. Goel was initially charged on Dec. 13, but Raheja was added to a superseding indictment on Wednesday, which also alleged the short-term rental property scam included discrimination against Black people. When guests searched for rental housing in these areas, they found multiple listings of Goel and Raheja's properties as the business would run ""secret bidding wars,"" the indictment said. Operators used fake host names, and in certain instances, other people's identities, to list properties. Goel, Raheja and others who worked with them are alleged to have owned and leased properties throughout the U.S. for the rental business, including properties in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago and Savannah, Georgia. By 2019, the business managed almost 100 properties across the United States. Some renters who believed they booked a property would at the last minute receive a cancellation with ""bogus last-minute excuses,"" the indictment said. These guests would be steered to inferior rental properties, still paying the same prices. These ""bait and switch"" methods allowed Goel and Raheja to keep their properties full at the highest listed prices possible, the indictment said. Operators also tried to avoid renting to guests they perceived were Black, the indictment said. ""The conspiracy charge alleging that the defendants discriminated against potential renters based on their skin color is a reprehensible abuse which must not be tolerated in the United States,"" said Donald Alway, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. In 2023, Airbnb said it removed 59,000 fake listings and prevented another 157,000 from joining the platform. The company said it planned to use AI to verify listings in its top five countries, which are the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France and Australia. Airbnb and Vrbo are cooperating with the government in the investigation, the Department of Justice said. The indictment charges Goel and Raheja with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 13 counts of wire fraud. Goel is also charged with two counts of aggravated identity theft. The conspiracy and wire fraud charges each carry a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. There is a two-year mandatory consecutive sentence for the counts of aggravated identity theft. Cara Tabachnick is a news editor and journalist at CBSNews.com.

"BPA, phthalates ""widespread"" in supermarket foods, CR report finds",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bpa-phthalates-plastic-chemicals-consumer-reports-fda/,"Looking to reduce your exposure to plasticizers in the new year? Contrary to what you might think, shopping organic and avoiding plastic food packaging isn't a surefire way to avoid harmful chemicals such as BPA and phthalates. According to newresearchfrom Consumer Reports, phthalates and bisphenols — two chemicals linked to various health risks such as diabetes and hormone disruption — are ""widespread"" among supermarket staples and fast foods, regardless of their packaging and ingredients and whether or not they are certified organic. Researchers found that 99% of the supermarket and fast foods they tested contained phthalates, also known as plasticizers, which are chemicals that are added to plastics to make them more flexible. In addition, 79% of the food samples contained bisphenol A (BPA), an industrial chemical used in plastic manufacturing, and other bisphenols. Both chemicals have been found in studies to be hazardousto health. Among the supermarket foods tested, Annie's Organic Cheesy Ravioli proved to have the most phthalates at 53,579 per nanogram, followed by Del Monte sliced peaches which contain 24,928 phthalates per nanogram and Chicken of the Sea pink salmon, which has 24,321 phthalates per nanogram. The chemical levels found in those pre-packaged foods proved much higher than even those of several fast-food items CR tested, including McDonald's Quarter Pounder With Cheese, which has 9,956 phthalates per nanogram and Little Caesars Classic Cheese Pizza (cardboard box) which contains 5,703 phthalates per nanogram. However, researchers found one fast-food favorite, Wendy's Crispy Chicken Nuggets, had a whopping 33,980 phthalates per nanogram. Just one product, a can of Polar Seltzer Raspberry Lime, tested negative for phthalates. CR's tested 85 foods for three bisphenols and 10 phthalates, as well as some of their common chemical substitutes, analyzing two or three samples of each product. The tested foods included prepared meals, fruits and vegetables, milk and other dairy products, baby food, fast food, meat and seafood, all of which came in various types of packaging, from cans to pouches to foil. In several studies, phthalates have been linked to reproductive disorders and genital abnormalities, the National Research Council said in a 2008 report. Research on BPA, links the chemical to high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, according to Mayo Clinic. Previously thought to make their way into pre-packaged foods exclusively through packaging, plastic chemicals can leach into food products in a number of ways, Consumer Reports found. Phthalates can get into foods through tubing, conveyor belts and gloves used during food processing, as well as get into meat and produce through contaminated water and soil, according to CR. Safety activists have long argued for a federal ban on the use of plasticizers in food packaging and processing, but have been mostly unsuccessful. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administrationrejecteda petition calling for a ban on the use of phthalates in food packaging and food processing. Few regulations restricting the use of phthalates exist and current thresholds for bisphenol A (BPA) and some other phthalates, are considered outmoded by many experts. ""Many of these thresholds do not reflect the most current scientific knowledge, and may not protect against all the potential health effects,"" CR scientist Tunde Akinleye, who oversaw the tests, said in the report. ""We don't feel comfortable saying these levels are okay. They're not."" Also, there's a larger picture to be considered, he noted. Given our cumulative exposure to phthalates which are found in so many of the products we use and foods we eat each day, Akinleye says it is hard to quantify what levels of phthalates should be considered ""safe"" in any one single product. ""The more we learn about these chemicals, including how widespread they are, the more it seems clear that they can harm us even at very low levels,"" he said.

Supreme Court agrees to hear Colorado case over Trump's 2024 ballot eligibility,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-colorado-case-2024-ballot-supreme-court/,"Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review a politically explosive decision from Colorado's top court that found former President Donald Trump ineligible for the presidency and would leave him off the state's primary ballot, stepping into a high-stakes legal showdown that could have major ramifications for the 2024 presidential election. The court set a swift schedule for filings from the parties in the appeal brought by Trump and said in abrief order that arguments will be held Feb. 8. A decision could come quickly after arguments, since Super Tuesday, when Colorado and more than a dozen states will hold their primaries or caucuses, is scheduled for March 5. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court to hear the case and in a statement expressed confidence that ""the fair-minded Supreme Court will unanimously affirm the civil rights of President Trump, and the voting rights of all Americans in a ruling that will squash all of the remaining ballot challenge hoaxes once and for all."" At the center of the dispute is the Constitution's so-called insurrection clause, a Civil War-era provision that bars a person who has sworn an oath to defend the Constitution and then engages in insurrection from holding public office. The Colorado Supreme Court concluded in a divided, 4-3 decision on Dec. 19 that Trump is disqualified from serving as president because of his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and barred him from being listed on the state's primary ballot. But the state's high court paused its decision to allow the former president and the Colorado GOP time to appeal. The court fight over Trump's eligibility for the White House sends the Supreme Court into new territory, as it has never before ruled directly on the 155-year-old provision at the center of the case, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. It also puts the nation's highest court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, in a position to potentially play a pivotal role in the 2024 election — the outcome of the case could decide whether Trump is eligible for ballot, not only in Colorado, but in the 49 other states. Colorado's high court was the first and only state court to find Trump is ineligible for the White House, and its explosive ruling marked the first time a presidential candidate has been found to be disqualified under Section 3. Maine's secretary of state reached a similar conclusion about the former president in response to two challenges brought by voters seeking to kick Trump off the state's primary ballot. The former president has appealed the decision by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows to the Maine Superior Court. Bellows, a Democrat, paused the effect of her ruling to allow the appeals process to play out. The Colorado case was brought by a group of six voters — four Republicans and two unaffiliated — who argued that Trump could not appear on the primary ballot because his actions related to the Jan. 6 riot rendered him ineligible for the White House under Section 3. Enacted after the Civil War, the provision was intended to keep former Confederates out of office. It has rarely been used in modern times. A state trial court in Denver ruled in November that the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 constituted an insurrection and found Trump engaged in insurrection, marking the first time a judge has reached such a conclusion about his conduct. But the judge ruled that Section 3 does not apply to the presidency or someone who has taken the presidential oath, and ordered Trump to be listed on the primary ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court, though, reversed the lower court's finding about the scope of Section 3 and, in its 4-3 decision, said Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency. ""We do not reach these conclusions lightly. We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us,"" the majority wrote in its opinion. ""We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach."" Trump and the Colorado Republican Party appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, urging the justices to overturn the state high court's ruling. All parties, including the voters who challenged Trump's eligibility, pushed the court to decide the issue swiftly. If allowed to stand, the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling would ""mark the first time in the history of the United States that the judiciary has prevented voters from casting ballots for the leading major-party presidential candidate,"" lawyers for the former president warned the justices in a filing. They called the question of Trump's eligibility one of ""paramount importance,"" and urged the Supreme Court to ""return the right to vote for their candidate of choice to the voters."" ""The Colorado Supreme Court decision would unconstitutionally disenfranchise millions of voters in Colorado and likely be used as a template to disenfranchise tens of millions of voters nationwide,"" his lawyers said. The case presents a number of novel questions that the high court will consider, including whether Jan. 6 was an insurrection and one Trump engaged in, as the Colorado courts concluded. The justices also are likely to weigh whether the former president and presidency are covered by Section 3. The Colorado Supreme Court ruled against Trump on all of those matters. The challenges to the former president's eligibility in Colorado and Maine are among efforts pursued in more than 30 states that aimed to keep Trump off the ballot, though they have been the only two to prevail so far. In Michigan, the state supreme court denied a request to review a lower court decision that allowed Trump to remain on the primary ballot. In Minnesota, the state's highest court tossed out a challenge by voters as to the primary ballot, concluding that the primary is an ""internal party election to serve internal party purposes."" Secretaries of state in a handful of other states— including California, New Hampshire and Oregon — have indicated they cannot unilaterally withhold Trump's name from the ballot. The battle over Trump's eligibility is not the only case involving the former president to land before the Supreme Court. In December the justices agreed to hear a case involving the reach of a federal obstruction law that has been used to prosecute hundreds of defendants for their alleged actions during the Jan. 6 attack, including Trump. The former president faces four federal charges related to an alleged attempt to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election and has pleaded not guilty. Arising out of his prosecution is another fight over whether he is entitled to broad immunity from criminal charges. A federal appeals court is weighing whether to uphold the district court's finding that Trump is not shielded from federal prosecution for alleged acts committed while in office, and its ruling will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court.

What's in the latest release of Epstein-related documents?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-epstein-documents-list-unsealed-files-whats-new/,"A third round of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was made public Friday, adding to a trove of information related to Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. The documents reveal more names and details about people connected to Epstein in a variety of ways, most of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing. The documents — 155 exhibits totaling 2,644 pages all together — stem from a now-settled defamation lawsuit brought against Maxwell by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre. Maxwell, 60, a former romantic partner of Epstein's, was found guilty in 2021 of conspiring to sexually abuse underage girls and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for her role. Giuffre has called Maxwell ""the mastermind"" behind the sex trafficking ring. The judge overseeing the lawsuit ordered in December that the documents should be unsealed and made public pending appeals from people whose names appear in them. The hundreds of pages of depositions, incident reports, court filings, emails and other documents include names of witnesses, accusers, members of Epstein's staff, members of law enforcement and others. Among the documents released Friday was one that contained the names of witnesses Maxwell's attorneys said likely had information that could dispute some of the allegations from Giuffre. Other newly released documents include excerpts from witness depositions; a list of phone numbers of vendors and service people with hand-written annotations; several communications between attorneys; a list of search terms used to sift through electronic records as part of the discovery process; about 50 pages of handwritten phone messages from Epstein's message book; and other court records related to discovery and other procedural steps. Portions of a transcript of Maxwell's videotaped deposition were also released. In the July 22, 2016 deposition, her attorney repeatedly advised her not to answer questions regarding sexual activities that involved herself or Epstein. The opposing attorney repeatedly sparred with Maxwell's attorney over whether Maxwell could answer questions related to Epstein's massages. Giuffre's attorneys then filed motions to compel Maxwell to answer deposition questions related to adult sexual activities. The motion was granted. Earlier sets of documents were unsealed Wednesday and Thursday, comprising hundreds of pages and mentioning more than 100 names. Despite widespread and sometimes heated speculation about whose names might appear, the highly anticipated documents largely pertained to previously known accusations — in some cases providing greater detail than previously known, including transcripts of video depositions and police incident reports — and legal strategy for the defamation case between Maxwell and Giuffre. Many have referred to the documents as a list, but only one document released earlier this week contained a list of names. While that list does include some high-profile names — such as former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew, both of whom have denied all wrongdoing in the case — the list is of people Giuffre's attorneys considered deposing in the lawsuit and is not an accusation of wrongdoing. The case of the billionaire financier who was also convicted on sex crimes charges related to the abuse of underage girls has been the subject of much speculation and many conspiracy theories. Epstein's friendships and connections with wealthy and powerful people, some of whom are mentioned in the documents in a variety of contexts, have drawn particular scrutiny, especially in the wake of his 2019 suicide in jail while awaiting trial in New York on federal charges of sex trafficking conspiracy and a count of sex trafficking. As part of a 2008 plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida, Epstein served 13 months in jail — often allowed out on work release — for state-level offenses in return for avoiding prosecution on federal charges for allegations of sexually abusing underage girls. While he had to register as a sex offender and pay settlements to victims, victims were not told about the agreement — leading to an investigation of the circumstances surrounding it, which was in progress when he died. The documents released this week also detail how authorities believe Epstein recruited the girls he allegedly exploited for sex — euphemistically termed ""massages"" — uncovered as part of the initial investigation into allegations against him. Among the many accusations leveled at Epstein over the years involve alleged abuse at his homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Florida and his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands near St. Thomas, Little St. James.

Supreme Court lets Idaho enforce abortion ban for now and agrees to hear case,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban/,"Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to let Idaho enforce its near-total ban on abortion in certain emergency medical situations while legal proceedings continue and said it will take up the dispute involving whether the Biden administration can require under federal law hospitals in states that ban abortion to perform the procedure on pregnant patients whose lives are at risk. The question raised in the case is whether that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, preempts state laws restricting access to abortion. The dispute, between the Biden administration and the state of Idaho, is one of several involving abortion that has arisen following the Supreme Court's landmark decision unwinding the constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court said in a brief order that it would put on hold a lower court ruling that blocked Idaho from enforcing its abortion ban in certain medical emergencies until it issues a decision in the case. Arguments will be heard in its April session. Enacted in 2020, Idaho's measure makes it a felony for doctors to perform most abortions, with an exception for procedures performed when necessary to save the life of the mother. The law took effect when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, joining so-called trigger bans in more than a dozen states that went into force following the high court's ruling. In the wake of Roe's reversal, the Justice Department sued Idaho in federal court over the law, arguing that it violates the Constitution and is preempted by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. The law requires health care providers that receive Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment, such as emergency abortion care, to a mother whose health is at risk. A U.S. district court in Idaho found the state's law conflicts with EMTALA's requirements and blocked it from being enforced for abortions necessary to avoid a ""serious impairment"" to the patient or placing the health of the mother in ""serious jeopardy."" ""We should not forget the one person with the greatest stake in the outcome of this case — the pregnant patient, laying on a gurney in an emergency room facing the terrifying prospect of a pregnancy complication that may claim her life,"" U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill wrote in an August 2022 order imposing a preliminary injunction. He continued: ""One cannot imagine the anxiety and fear she will experience if her doctors feel hobbled by an Idaho law that does not allow them to provide the medical care necessary to preserve her health and life."" Winmill said ""it's impossible to comply"" with both EMTALA and Idaho's measure. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit granted the Idaho legislature's request to enforce the law while litigation continued. But after reviewing the panel's decision, the full 9th Circuit reinstated the lower court's injunction in October. The appeals court set oral arguments in the case for late January. Idaho officials sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in late November, arguing that the federal government can't use EMTALA ""to override in the emergency room state laws about abortion any more than it can use it to override state law on organ transplants or marijuana use."" The injunction put in place by the district court, they wrote, ""effectively turns EMTALA's protection for the uninsured into a federal super-statute on the issue of abortion, one that strips Idaho of its sovereign interest in protecting innocent human life and turns emergency rooms into a federal enclave where state standards of care do not apply."" But the Biden administration told the high court that the exception to Idaho's ban is narrower than EMTALA and criminalizes care that is required by federal law, as an emergency room doctor who decides an abortion is necessary to stabilize a patients' condition cannot do so until her condition has deteriorated significantly. If Idaho's law were allowed to take effect, it ""would cause serious, tangible harms to the United States and to the public,"" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the court in a filing. ""A stay would increase the risk that pregnant patients will face irreversible injuries, such as strokes, amputations, hysterectomies, and organ failure, that could have been prevented with appropriate emergency care,"" she wrote. ""If a stay issues, physicians will be placed in an impossible position, unable to provide 'medically necessary' care and 'put[ting] the health of Idaho women at significant risk.'"" President Biden said in a Friday statement that healthcare decisions should not be made by politicians. ""These bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other states because of laws that interfere with their ability to care for their patients. This should never happen in America, "" Biden said. A case similar to Idaho's is proceeding in Texas. A federal district court there sided with the state and blocked the Biden administration from requiring Texas hospitals and doctors to perform abortions in emergency medical situations when it conflicts with the state's law outlawing most abortions. A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling earlier this month,siding with Texas. Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

"Trump should be barred from New York real estate industry, New York AG says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-should-be-barred-new-york-real-estate-industry-fined-370-million-letitia-james-says/,"Donald Trump made his name in New York real estate, and he plastered it on towers, plazas and skating rinks for half a century. Now, the state's attorney general wants to take it down and bar him from ever again working in the industry, at least in New York. In a filing Friday before closing arguments in Trump's civil fraud trial, lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James said they also want Trump and other defendants billed $370 million for ""ill-gotten gains,"" plus additional interest. The filing, a sort of preview of the arguments scheduled for Jan. 11, claims ""the myriad deceptive schemes they employed to inflate asset values and conceal facts were so outrageous that they belie innocent explanation."" The $370 million figure is a significant increase from the $250 million clawback James' office initially said it was seeking when it filed suit against the Trumps in September 2022. A New York judge found Trump, his two adult sons, their company, and two former executives liable for a decade of fraud in September. The trial in the case, on allegations related to conspiracy, falsification of business records and insurance fraud, ran from October through early December . James' office argues in its filing that it proved Trump and the company purposefully juiced their estimates of property values — and his overall net worth — in financial statements used to get unusually favorable deals on loans and insurance. During the trial, the state's lawyers showed internal corporate spreadsheets and communications that they said bolstered their case of a yearslong, coordinated effort to vastly misrepresent Trump's wealth. ""Direct evidence from multiple witnesses establishes Trump made known his desired target net worth each year….which his CFO and Controller then dutifully set out to hit by reverse-engineering the asset values,"" James' attorneys wrote in Friday's filing. They said Trump ""failed to present any legally relevant response to the People's proof."" Christopher Kise, an attorney for Trump, said in a text message to CBS News that the request for $370 million by New York Attorney General Letitia James is ""unconscionable, unsupported by the evidence, untethered from reality, and unconstitutionally excessive."" In a filing Friday, lawyers for Trumps wrote that ""The Attorney General has woefully failed to prove her case and is not entitled to any of the relief sought in this action."" Trump and his co-defendants have vehemently denied the allegations. During testimony in November, he accused James and Judge Arthur Engoron of targeting him unfairly. In addition to the lifetime New York real estate ban for Trump and the former executives, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney, James' office is also seeking five-year bans for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.		 Engoron's final ruling in the case is expected weeks after the Jan. 11 closing arguments.

Roedema, Jason Rosenblatt, and Nathan Woodyard were all indicted by a grand jury for forcibly restraining McClain in a violent struggle that was captured on police body cam video. On Oct. 12, a Colorado jury reached a split verdict in Adams County Court for two Aurora police officers, Roedema and Rosenblatt who were on trial for thedeath of Elijah McClain. RELATED:Colorado may soon bar police and coroners from referencing ""excited delirium"" in lethal force cases The jury found Roedema guilty of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault, while Rosenblatt was found not guilty of manslaughter and assault. Woodyard was found not guilty on Nov. 6 of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Woodyard reportedly returned to the department after he was acquitted of the charges. According to the Aurora Police Department, Woodyard is no longer suspended without pay following his Nov. 6 acquittal. He reportedly reintegrated with the department and is currently on restricted duty. That means he is not in uniform, has no public contact and no enforcement actions pending next steps in the reintegration process, according to the Aurora Police Department. A jury also founded two Aurora paramedics guilty of criminally negligent homicide on Dec. 22 when the 23-year-old Black man was walking home from the grocery store and confronted by officers, who were seen on bodycam video, forcibly restraining him while Aurora Fire Rescue paramedics -- Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec -- injected him with ketamine.  McClain went into cardiac arrest in an ambulance a few minutes later and died three days after that.

Cichuniec was taken into custody immediately following the verdict. Following the announcement on the sentencing for Roedema, Elijah McClain's mother Sheneen McClain spoke and believes that everyone who was involved in the death of her son on that night back in August of 2019, didn't show any remorse. ""Our communities cannot know peace until we see the justice departments hold their own enforcers accountable,"" she said. ""My son will never be a dad, an uncle, or a grandfather.

Wayne LaPierre to resign from NRA ahead of corruption trial,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wayne-lapierre-resigns-from-nra-ahead-of-corruption-trial/,"Wayne LaPierre is stepping down from the National Rifle Association after more than three decades as the leader of the gun rights advocacy group. The decision came as LaPierre, 74, faces an impending legal showdown in New York, where jury selection has already begun in a civil lawsuit filed by Attorney General Letitia James, who has accused top officials of the organization, including LaPierre, of diverting millions of dollars for their personal use. At the helm of the NRA since 1991, LaPierre, the group's executive vice president and CEO, said his exit will take effect on January 31. ""With pride in all that we have accomplished, I am announcing my resignation from the NRA,"" LaPierre said in a statement released by the NRA. ""I've been a card-carrying member of this organization for most of my adult life, and I will never stop supporting the NRA and its fight to defend Second Amendment freedom. My passion for our cause burns as deeply as ever."" James' lawsuit against the NRA, LaPierre and others is scheduled to start on Monday, with LaPierre among those expected to testify. LaPierre and three others are accused of illegally diverting tens of millions of dollars from the NRA and spending the nonprofit's funds on vacations and other questionable expenditures. James responded to LaPierre's announced resignation by calling the development ""an important victory"" that ""validates"" her office's claims against him. ""We look forward to presenting our case in court,"" the attorney general said in a poston X, formerly known as Twitter. The suit filed by James in 2020seeks to ban LaPierre and others from serving in leadership roles of any not-for-profit or charitable organization doing business in New York, which would effectively bar them from involvement with the NRA.

"Northeastern U.S. preparing for snow, rain, ice over the weekend",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/weather-us-northeast-weekend-storm-snow-rain-ice/,"Millions of people across the eastern U.S. are preparing for a wintry mix of precipitation as a potent storm system looks to bring snow, freezing rain and ice to the region.  The system is expected to reach North Carolina by Saturday morning and then track along the northeastern coastline throughout the weekend. It could bring to Philadelphia and other major cities amounts of snow not seen in several years. The heaviest snowfall is expected in regions including the Poconos in Pennsylvania, parts of the Hudson Valley and portions of New England. However, winter storm warnings and watches were in effect throughout much of the Northeast. Chris Stachelski of the National Weather Service said localized accumulations of snowfall could exceed one foot in areas of higher elevation. Elsewhere, the concern is ice — with up to a quarter of an inch forecast for parts of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia.  Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city was preparing for the snowstorm but wasn't expecting it to be a major event, and the timing of the snow means it would likely have less of an impact on city life. Storm surges, often a problem with winter storms, were also not expected. ""We are thankfully hoping that the projections stay where they have been trending, which is that the weather really will begin tomorrow evening into Sunday and hopefully let up in time for it to be taken care of before Monday commutes and Monday starts to school,"" Wu said.  A snowfall drought has been setting records across the eastern U.S. — and this storm may end it in some cities. For the number of consecutive days with less than an inch of snow, Philadelphia reached 705 days through Friday — beating the prior record of 661 days that ended on Dec. 15, 1973.  New York City went 691 days through Friday, outstripping the prior record of 383 days that ended on March 21, 1998. Baltimore reached 707 days through Friday, a record, with a prior record of 672 days that ended on Dec. 25, 2012. Temperatures have been warmer than normal, making it hard for precipitation to fall as snow. Some storms that recently tracked through the Northeast were carrying warm air from the South and moisture that fell as rain, Stachelski said.  El Nino effects also played a role, he said, by preventing cold air from getting into the East long enough to interact with moisture that storms are bringing, which is key for precipitation to fall as snow. Pedro DiNezio, associate professor of oceanic and atmospheric science at the University of Colorado Boulder, said the pattern of rain - rather than snow - in the fall and winter has been predicted by climate models. ""It will snow less frequently and more of the storms will dump rain as opposed to snow in the U.S. Northeast,"" he said.  Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont says it's been about two years since a major storm has hit the state. ""I think this storm's been a long time coming,"" Lamont said. ""It's been over two years since we've had a storm of this magnitude, 6 to 12 inches. We've got a lot of salt piled up here; it's been piling up for a while (and) some shiny new snow plows."" State Transportation Commission Garrett Eucalitto said his department will have about 900 drivers on duty, including 630 snow plows. There will also be about 200 contractors working on the state highways. But he said that is fewer than in the past.  ""We have about 115 vacancies right now in our driver pool,"" he said. ""So our employees will come in tomorrow evening and they are not going to go home until the storm is concluded."" He said the state is also short about a quarter of the contractors it normally uses, because of difficulties they have had filling jobs. Parts of central Maine were hit hard by a December storm that brought flooding and cut power to more than 400,000 customers in a state of less than 1.4 million people. Only a few hundred customers were without power on Friday, but authorities in the state cautioned residents to prepare for the weekend storm. Authorities in Maine cautioned that another storm could closely follow the weekend snow. That storm is expected to arrive Tuesday into Wednesday and could bring snow, rain and bad road conditions, officials said. ""We urge Maine people to continue to follow forecasts and to prepare themselves in advance,"" said Maine Emergency Management Agency Director Pete Rogers.",2024-01-05,The storm could bring to Philadelphia and other major cities amounts of snow not seen in several years.

Some Verizon customers can claim part of $100 million settlement. Here's how.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/verizon-settlement-how-to-file-a-claim/,"Some Verizon customers may be eligible to claim part of a $100 million class-action settlement, but they'll have to act soon to cash in. The settlement resolves a lawsuit with Verizon Wireless subscribers alleging the mobile service provider tacked on an extra ""administrative charge"" to customers' monthly bills to ""extract additional cash"" from them.  Here's what to know about the settlement. Verizon is shelling out the money to settle a lawsuit filed by current and former customers last year. In the complaint, lawyers for Verizon users allege the company ""deceived"" subscribers by unlawfully tacking on an additional ""administrative charge"" to their service bills ""without [their] consent."" In addition, Verizon ""never adequately or honestly disclosed"" the fee to its customers before they subscribed to its services, and ""uniformly charged them higher monthly rates than it advertised and promised,"" lawyers said in the complaint. Verizon denies any wrongdoing, according to the settlement website. The company did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. Current and former Verizon customers who had a postpaid wireless or data service plan and were charged an ""Administrative Charge and/or an Administrative and Telco Recovery charge"" between Jan. 1, 2016, and Nov. 8, 2023, are eligible to receive compensation under the settlement, the settlement agreement shows. Postpaid wireless plans are those in which holders pay for services at the end of a monthly billing cycle. For eligible Verizon customers, the initial payout will be between $15 and $100, depending on the length of time the claimant has been a customer. Affected Verizon customers must file a compensation request form through the claims website.

You should opt out if you intend on filing a separate complaint against Verizon over any claims contained in the class-action lawsuit. To opt out, claimants must mail a signed exclusion request to the settlement administrator by Feb. 20.

What can Americans expect for the economy in 2024?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economy-axios-financial-expert-what-to-expect-in-2024-javier-david/,"Although fears of a U.S. recession loomed over much of 2023, a resilient economy surprised forecastersby gaining speed on the strength of robust consumer spending and solid job gains. So what can we expect for 2024? Here's what one financial pundit had to say. ""The funny thing about 2024 is that there's nothing entirely new under the sun,"" said Javier David, managing editor, business and markets, at Axios and a CBS News contributor. ""Most of the themes include a continuation of what was the last year. They're all interconnected — inflation, Fed policy and response, jobs market, recession fears."" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in December hinted atinterest rate cuts in 2024 as inflation cools. That spark of hope has led some economists to speculate on not if, but when those rate cuts may begin. Despite a strong December jobs report, a potential inflation risk if the economy continues to run hot, many experts remain optimistic that the central bank will lower rates this year. Still, David cautioned that there may be many bumps ahead for the economy on the road to possible interest rate cuts. ""So the thing here that everybody needs to keep in mind is inflation has been tamed, the preferred gauge the Fed watches is floating around the Fed's target of 2%, but the risks are still there, and that's particularly because consumers have continued to open up their wallets and add to their credit card debt,"" he said. Consumer spending rose at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September in 2023, and shoppers continued to open their walletsfor the holidays despite the fact that many Americans say they're spending more than they earn. That aligns with 2023 data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that shows consumers owe a record $986 billion in credit card debt, up 17% from 2022. ""The paradox is everyone expects the Fed to cut, but they're only going to do so unless conditions turn recessionary. Currently, they are not,"" said David, who emphasized the correlation between robust consumer spending and the economy's strength. ""We should all thank our lucky stars that the American people continue to spend, because our economy is two-thirds consumer spending ... that's what's driving this train, that's what's keeping the jobs market afloat, that's what's keeping companies from mass layoffs."" Even if consumers rein in spending and the economy slips into a recession, he said, there's a good chance it will be mild. ""We're entering 2024 much like we entered 2023. Everyone was fearful of a recession. People think a recession will happen, but all recessions aren't created equal. We could see a downturn. We don't have to see a repeat of 2020 or 2008, which were pretty extreme Black Swan events that really created tough economic conditions. So we could see a softening without a collapse in economic activity."" What's the biggest X factor for the economy in 2024? That would be the outcome of November's national election, according to David. ""I'm not in the predictions game, but I do think things are going to get dicey closer to the elections. And the election is arguably the biggest wild card and the only real unknown hanging over the 2024 economy. So I do think we'll see a Fed cut in the second half, but not before then.""",2024-01-05,"Many experts remain optimistic that the central bank will lower rates this year. Consumer spending rose at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September in 2023. Even if consumers rein in spending and the economy slips into a recession, there's a good chance it will be mild."
Student loan borrowers face long hold times and inaccurate bills,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-consumer-financial-protection-bureau/,"As monthly payments for federally owned student loans restart after a pandemic-induced pause of more than three years, borrowers are facing myriad problems including long hold times for help and inaccurate billing statements, finds a report published on Friday. Borrowers are frequently place on hold for more than an hour when calling their servicer, and many give up before getting assistance, a particular problem given the number of faulty and confusing bills being sent by student loan companies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in its findings. Average call wait times to speak to a live representative have risen from 12 minutes in August 2023 to more than an hour, according to the agency, which notes borrowers calling their servicer in the last two weeks of October were put on hold an average 73 minutes. One consumer reportedly waited more than nine hours, or 565 minutes, to speak with a service representative, the agency noted. Understandably, the longer folks are put on hold, the likelier they are to get frustrated and hang up before getting connected, with 47% doing just that in October, opposed to the August hang-up rate of 17%, according to the agency's findings. More than 1.25 million income-driven repayment plan applications were submitted between August and October, with more than 450,000 with a servicer pending for more than 30 days without resolution. Processing times vary, with some services taking five times longer than others to process applications, putting borrowers at risk of having to make significantly higher payments than they can afford. Faulty and confusing bills from loan service companies include premature due dates and inflated monthly payments based on outdated poverty guidelines, the CFPB found. The government in March 2020 announced the suspension of federal student loan payments, with interest also waived. Congress in June of 2023 passed legislation ending the pause, with payments resuming a few months ago. ""The resumption of student loan payments means that borrowers are making billions of dollars of payments each month,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a news release. ""If student loan companies are cutting corners or sidestepping the law, this can pose serious risks to individuals and the economy."" The resumption of student loan payments coincided with an announcement by the Biden administration that it would forgive $9 billion in student debt for 125,000 borrowers. Another $5 billion in debt forgiveness for more than 80,000 borrowers came in December, bringing to $132 billion the total of approved debt cancellation by the administration for more than 3.6 million Americans. The Supreme Court in June invalidated the administration's plan for broad-based student loan forgiveness that would have helped more than 40 million borrowers each erase as much as $20,000 in debt. Borrowers can visitstudentaid.govto apply for this latest round of forgiveness.

American Values promoted the event last week by sharing it on X, previously known as Twitter, and the Daily Mail reported the appearance of all four stars at the gala.

But soon after the PAC's social media post appeared, Sheen said in an Instagram story, ""I do not endorse RFK Jr. nor I will I be attending his party.""

Bradley Whitford, who played Sheen's White House deputy chief of staff in the TV series, reiterated on X that Sheen is not supporting Kennedy. ""There's a story going around saying that Martin Sheen is supporting @RobertKennedyJr for president. The story is incorrect,"" Whitford said on X. Warwick called the PAC's announcement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and said she was unaware of the event. ""I don't know anything about this event.

"Haley says she ""should have said slavery"" in Civil War answer",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-slavery-civil-war-pardoning-trump-iowa/,"GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley says now that she should have mentioned slavery when she was asked about the cause of the Civil War last week. At a CNN town hall in Iowa Thursday, days before Iowans caucus in the first GOP presidential nominating contest, Haley told moderator Erin Burnett, ""I should have said slavery, but in my mind, that's a given that everybody associates the Civil War with slavery."" The former South Carolina governor was asked by Burnett to respond to opponent Chris Christie's criticism that her answer stemmed not from being ""dumb or racist,"" but from an unwillingness to offend anyone by telling the truth. When she was asked last Wednesday in New Hampshire what caused the Civil War, Haley responded that she thought the cause ""was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do."" Democrats and Republicans like Christie were quick to seize upon her response. At Thursday's town hall, Haley went on to say that growing up in the South, slavery is a ""very talked about thing"" and in her response in New Hampshire, ""I was thinking past slavery, and talking about the lesson that we would learn going forward. I shouldn't have done that."" In addition to her previous remarks on slavery, Haley also expanded on why she'd pardon former President Trump if he's convicted of federal crimes and she's elected president. One Iowa voter asked her to explain why she'd pardon Trump, even though he's associated with chaos in the country. Haley, noting that he'd have to be found guilty first, said it would be better for the country. ""It's about what's in the best interest for the country, and I don't think our country will move forward with an 80-year-old president sitting in jail,"" she said. ""That allows our country to continue to be divided."" She went on to say the country has to move on past that in order to ""get out of the chaos."" In the wake of the school shooting that unfolded Thursday morning in Perry, Iowa, killing a sixth-grade student and injuring 5 others, Haley promised to address the nation's mental health crisis upon taking office. ""We have got to deal with the cancer that is mental health."" Haley says she does not favor more firearms restrictions. ""We could go and take away a certain kind of gun today and that would make you feel better today,"" Haley said Thursday. ""But a week from now there'd be another shooting."" Haley blames insufficient mental health care for gun violence and has called for more therapists and mental health centers nationwide, and she also supports more protective measures for schools, securing them ""the same way we secure our airports and our courthouses."" Haley has also been criticized for a joke she made during a campaign stop earlier this week in Milford, New Hampshire, when she told an audience of roughly 700 voters, ""You know, Iowa starts it; you know that you correct it."" She was calling for their support during the state's primary, which follows soon after the Iowa caucuses.  GOP presidential opponent Ron DeSantis immediately pounced, calling Haley ""incredibly disrespectful to Iowans to say somehow their votes need to be corrected."" The Florida governor, who was being interviewed on a radio show Thursday, added, ""I think she's trying to provide an excuse for her not doing well."" Haley's comments even got a rise out of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who took to ""X"" to tweet, ""I trust Iowans to make their own decisions. No 'corrections' needed!"" Iowans booed Haley on this topic Thursday night at the town hall, but she defended her remarks, saying, ""I don't live, eat and breathe politics all the time. I like to have fun, too.""

Is a plant-based diet really healthier? Experts weigh in.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plant-based-diet-healthier-experts/,"New year, new you? Your nutrition can help you not only look but feel better — and experts point to plant-based diets as a health-forward option for 2024 and beyond. ""Low carbohydrate diets do tend to promote weight loss, but the nutritional value of the diet still really matters. So what you want to be doing is looking for diets that are high in protein and fiber, but you want to be getting those nutrients from plant-based foods more than meat based foods,"" says Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. ""When you make those adjustments to your diet, we do see a greater weight loss."" Vegan diets aren't the only way to eat plant-based. TheMediterranean diet, for example — which as made headlines for its health benefits — also focuses on whole, plant ingredients. Patterned on the traditional cuisines of the region, the diet emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts and whole grains. ""This is basically a low carbohydrate diet that's also low in animal fats and proteins,"" Gounder said. ""You're going to have a lot of fish, beans, lentils, whole grains, fruits and vegetables."" She also noted the foods tend to be healthier when flavored with herbs and spices as opposed to salt. In terms of protein, Gounder suggests looking towards more plant-based proteins like beans and lentils as opposed to red meat. And she offered a word of caution about some meat alternatives made with processed plant proteins. ""Things like plant based burgers, for example, are getting more and more popular. They are very high protein, but they may also be high in saturated fats,"" she explains. ""Some of them do have this long list of ultra-processed ingredients, so they may not always be so great for you."" If you are looking for a meat alternative, she suggests looking at the list of ingredients. ""Maybe something like a very simple black bean burger as opposed to some of the other alternatives,"" she suggests. ""If you can't pronounce the words in the list of ingredients, it's probably ultra-processed."" In general, ultra-processed foods are better avoided, nutrition experts say. ""You do see an increased risk in high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, even depression with these ultra-processed foods,"" Gounder adds. Experts also point to plant-based diets as a vital component in supporting gut health. Dr. Aditya Sreenivasan, a gastroenterologist atLenox Hill Hospital, said the advice is basically simple: ""It's just a matter of quote-unquote 'being healthier' and eating a quote-unquote 'healthy' diet,"" he recently told CBS News. But he admits that it can be ""hard to to meet these criteria, especially living in this country."" What exactly does this way of eating look like? Focus on whole plant foods, Dr. Shilpa Ravella, transplant gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, previously told CBS News. ""Whole plant foods are incredibly important for gut health because they provide fiber for our gut microbes, and fiber is the most important nutrient for those gut microbes,"" Ravella says. Despite theimportance of fiberin our diets, only about5% of Americansmeet the recommended daily amounts. ""In this country we unfortunately have a fiber deficiency,"" she says. ""We need to go beyond those recommended daily amounts for optimal gut health."" Sara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

Video helps researchers link seizures to sudden unexplained child deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seizures-cause-sudden-unexplained-death-in-children-study-video/,"Seizures during sleep may be responsible for some sudden deaths in young children, according to researchers from NYU Langone Health who used home monitoring video donated by families of seven toddlers who died to analyze what may have caused it. Sudden unexplained death in childhood, or SUDC, is estimated to claim over 400 lives a year in the U.S., mostly during sleep. Just over half of those cases, about 250 deaths a year, are in 1- to 4-year-olds. The findings, published in the journal Neurology Thursday, show five of the seven toddlers died shortly after movements that a team of specialists deemed to be a brief seizure. The seizures lasted less than 60 seconds and occurred within 30 minutes prior to each child's death, the authors report. The two remaining recordings weren't nonstop like the other five and instead were triggered by sound or motion, turning on and off. One suggested muscle convulsion, a sign of seizure. ""Our study, although small, offers the first direct evidence that seizures may be responsible for some sudden deaths in children, which are usually unwitnessed during sleep,"" study lead investigator Laura Gould, a research assistant professor at NYU Langone, said in anews release. Dr. Orrin Devinsky, study senior investigator and neurologist, added that the findings show seizures are ""much more common than patients' medical histories suggest."" ""Further research is needed to determine if seizures are frequent occurrences in sleep-related deaths in toddlers, and potentially in infants, older children, and adults,"" he said. Is there anything parents can do to prevent this? CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who also works at NYU Langone but was not involved in the study, said there are no obvious warning signs — but parents can be aware of febrile seizures, or a convulsion caused by a fever. ""One little clue is there is an increased risk of febrile seizures — that's the seizures associated with fever in children — who then go on to have this unexplained death between the ages of 1 and 4,"" he said on ""CBS Mornings."" ""Now, it's very important to say... 3% of children have febrile seizures, and the vast majority, Dr. Devinsky just told me, go on to do perfectly well. So put this in perspective."" One toddler in the study had a documented history of febrile seizures, but all the children revealed no definitive cause of death after undergoing an autopsy. ""Of course parents are concerned,"" LaPook said, but he emphasized these cases are ""very rare."" Gould told theAssociated Pressshe doesn't want families to be scared by the new findings either. She said she hopes future research can help determine the difference between the rare cases that result in death and kids who are fine after an occasional seizure. ""If we can figure out the children at risk, maybe we can change their outcome,"" she told the news agency. Sara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

FDA gives Florida green light to import drugs in bulk from Canada,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-canada-fda-pharmaceutical-imports-approval/,"For the first time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized a Florida program to import certain prescription drugs in bulk from Canada. The approval paves the way for other states to request permission to import medications from Canada, where drug prices are much cheaper, to significantly cut costs for American consumers. Floria's proposal specifies a number of drug classes, including medications for asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD; diabetes; HIV and AIDS; and mental illness. The medications would be only for certain people, including foster children, prison inmates, certain elderly patients and, eventually, Medicaid recipients. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports. President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports. DeSantis celebrated the FDA's move Friday, saying that the program will save the save up to $180 million in its first year alone by brining lower cost drugs to Floridians. ""After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,"" DeSantis said. ""It's about time that the FDA put patients over politics and the interests of Floridians over Big Pharma."" The state of Florida asserts that some medications are so costly — priced at nearly $400 per pill — that its health care budget is strained. On average, American drug costs are 218% of prices in Canada.  Florida has estimated that the program could save it up to $150 million annually. The FDA authorized the state's importation program for two years once the agency is notified of the first shipment of drugs ordered from Canada. State officials must first test the drugs to make sure they're authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards. Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, which oversees Medicaid in the state, will be required to provide the FDA with a quarterly report that includes information about any imported drugs, cost savings, and potential safety and quality issues. ""These proposals must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. U.S. pharmaceutical industry lobbyists have long opposed bulk importation programs and are expected to try to block the Florida program's implementation. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the main drug industry lobbying group in the U.S., said in a statement Friday that it strongly opposes the FDA's decision. ""We are deeply concerned with the FDA's reckless decision to approve Florida's state importation plan,"" PhRMA President and CEO Stephen J. Ubl said. ""Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health."" He added that ""PhRMA is considering all options for preventing this policy from harming patients."" Another advocacy group, the Partnership for Safe Medicines, which protects consumers against counterfeit and other unsafe prescription drugs, is also staunchly opposed to the FDA's move, arguing that it will put American consumers' health at risk. ""The United States government's decision to approve Florida's Canadian drug importation plan weakens our nation's safe drug supply, putting American patients at risk,"" Shabbir Safdar, the group's executive director, said in a statement Friday. ""This decision breaks our closed loop system and opens the door to counterfeiters and others who will be more than happy to meet demand."" —The Associated Press contributed to this report.

MLB star Wander Franco can leave Dominican Republic amid exploitation allegations,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wander-franco-tampa-bay-rays-sexual-exploitation-allegations/,"A Dominican judge on Friday ordered the conditional release of Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco while he is investigated for allegations he had a brief relationship with a 14-year-old girl and gave her mother a small car and thousands of dollars in exchange for her consent, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press. The judge said Franco is allowed to leave the Dominican Republic but must return once a month to meet with authorities. Franco, who was expected to be released early Saturday, did not speak to reporters after the hearing ended. The 22-year-old All-Star is accused of commercial sexual exploitation and money laundering. The girl's 35-year-old mother faces the same charges as Franco. The AP is not naming the woman in order to preserve her daughter's privacy. Franco, who was detained Monday in the northern province of Puerto Plata, hasn't been charged with any crimes. The judge has received a nearly 600-page document detailing the evidence that prosecutors gathered during a monthslong investigation. The athlete's lawyers have not commented other than saying that Franco was ""doing fine."" Prosecutors said the investigation began after they received an anonymous tip in July 2023 stemming from someone who saw a media post alluding to the relationship. The AP has not been able to verify the reported post. Authorities accuse Franco of taking the minor away from her home in Puerto Plata in December 2022 and having a four-month relationship with her with consent from the girl's mother. They accuse Franco of sending the mother monthly payments of $1,700 for seven months and buying her a car ""in order to allow the relationship and let her go out with him wherever she wanted,"" according to the document, which quoted the girl. The girl also was quoted as saying that she had demanded for a local digital media site to publish an item about her alleged relationship with the baseball player because she was ""tired"" of her mother, whom she accused of taking Franco's money and not sharing any of it with her. Days later, Franco published a live video alleging it was a scheme to extort money from him, the document stated. In September 2023, authorities raided the home of the girl's mother and seized 800,000 Dominican pesos ($13,700), as well as $68,500 they said was found hidden behind a frame. Another seizure at a different home found a guarantee certificate from a local bank for 2.1 million Dominican pesos ($36,000) that they said was delivered by Franco for the ""commercial and sexual exploitation"" of the girl. In addition, they seized a Suzuki Swift worth $26,600, according to the document. Authorities noted that days before the car was bought, the teenager's mother had the equivalent of $821 in her bank account. The mother also bought property in Puerto Plata worth $36,000, they said. Authorities also state that Franco's mother had sent money to the girl's mother, but she has not been charged in the case even though they said she got involved ""to avoid traces of her son with the accused."" Franco arrived at a court in Puerto Plata on Friday morning and remained silent while being escorted through a group of journalists who peppered with him questions. The girl's mother, who works at a local bank and was wearing sunglasses, also declined comment as she was escorted to a courtroom. Outside, a small group of young Dominican players donned in baseball attire gathered to support Franco, carrying posters that read, ""Free Franco,"" and ""We all are Franco."" Franco was having an All-Star season before being sidelined in August, when authorities in the Dominican Republic began investigating claims he had been in a relationship with a minor. Major League Baseball launched its own investigation, placing Franco on the restricted list on Aug. 14 before moving him to administrative leave on Aug. 22. Both investigations are ongoing. Franco signed a $182 million, 11-year contract in 2021. His salary last year and this year is $2 million per season.",2024-01-05,A Dominican judge orders the conditional release of Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco.

Israeli defense minister lays out vision for post-war Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-gaza-gallant-plan-post-war-hamas/,"Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday laid out a four-pronged plan for how Gaza could be governed after the war. While it is the first time a senior Israeli official has laid out such a vision, it does not represent official policy. Under the plan, Hamas would no longer control Gaza. Israel would maintain military operational freedom, but there would be no Israeli civilian presence there. The plan suggests that a U.S.-led international task force would be responsible for rebuilding Gaza. It says local Palestinian bodies would control civil affairs, and there would be roles for Egypt and other moderate Arab states. The plan does not mention the Palestinian Authority, the body that has powers in the occupied West Bank. Gallant said that the plan depended on Hamas no longer posing a security threat to Israel or Israeli citizens. The plan angered at least one member of Israel's far-right, ultranationalist coalition government, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. ""Gallant's 'day after' plan is a rerun of the 'day before' October 7. The solution for Gaza requires out-of-the-box thinking and a changed conception,"" Smotrich said, according to the Times of Israel newspaper. Smotrich and ultra-nationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have been advocating for the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, provoking rebuke from the United States. ""The rhetoric that we have seen from those two individuals was inflammatory, it was irresponsible and it was in direct contradiction of the policy of the government of Israel that has been repeatedly articulated to us, including by the prime minister himself,"" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a briefing Wednesday. ""We have been told that those statements do not reflect the policy of the government of Israel. We believe that is the correct decision. The secretary [Antony Blinken] has made very clear on a number of occasions that there must be no forced resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza, that Gaza is Palestinian land and should remain."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far not made any detailed comments about his vision for Gaza after the war. Fighting continues in Gaza, with the Hamas-run ministry of health saying dozens of people were killed in the last 24 hours. A health ministry official said that Israel had conducted airstrikes is al-Mawasi, an area designated safe by the Israel Defense Forces, and killed 14 people, CBS partner network BBC News reported. Over 22,400 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. About 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed in Hamas' brutal terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, and around 240 people were taken hostage. At least 170 IDF soldiers have been killed in the war since it began. And tensions continued to boil on other fronts. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said a response to the killing of Hamas official Saleh Al-Arouri in Beirut on Tuesday was ""inevitably coming."" ""We cannot remain silent on a violation of this magnitude because it means the whole of Lebanon would be exposed,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech, according to the AFP news agency. Nasrallah said that since the killing of Al-Arouri, Hezbollah fighters have carried out 670 operations and targeted 48 Israeli border positions and 11 rear bases, AFP reported. There have been exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon since the war began, sparking fears that the conflict could open up on another front. At least 175 people have been killed in Lebanon, including 129 Hezbollah fighters. In northern Israel, at least nine soldiers and four civilians have been killed, and thousands have been evacuated from their homes in border communities.

Englishman builds wall around home after years of flooding,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/englishmans-home-has-flooded-nearly-a-dozen-times-in-7-years-he-built-a-wall-nick-lupton/,"Nick Lupton's riverside home in Worcester, England, has been flooded nearly a dozen times in just seven years. To stop it, he built a massive wall that surrounds his home. Lupton and his wife, Annie, have lived near the River Severn in a 17th-century house on property worth more than $765,000, according to local news outlet Gloucestershire Live. And since 2016, their one acre of land and home has flooded 11 times, Lupton told multiple news agencies. Exhausted by the multiple clean-ups they have had to do over the years, Lupton and his wife spent spent months building a wall to protect their home in the high-risk flood zone, he told CBS News partner BBC. ""After we had, I think it was nine floods, before we decided to build a wall,"" Lupton told Reuters. ""And the wall is really there to make our lives easier, but also to protect the house long term. Having flood water up to the walls of a house is never going to be good."" They finished the wall mid-September, and when it was put to the test a month later by a flood, Lupton said it stood up to the challenge – and continues to do so. ""Thankfully it did what it was supposed to do. It passed the test,"" he said, adding that it also helped prevent damage when it was tested again this week. ""... It's been a very good test in many ways because it's one of the highest floods we've ever had."" There are hundreds of flooding alerts across England as of Friday afternoon local time, including more than 250 warnings that flooding is expected, and nearly 270 more saying flooding is possible. The U.K.'s Met Office has warned that the River Severn is expected to have flooding impacts through at least Friday and Saturday, although it could continue for ""several days"" in some parts. Of the 30 measuring stations across the river, 18 recorded ""high"" levels on Friday, with the measuring station in Worcester recording a height of 18.2 feet and rising as of 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday – just shy of the all-time station record of 18.99 feet recorded in 2020. The normal range of water levels at this location is between 1.8 and 11 feet. Lupton believes there are ""a lot of factors"" playing into the flooding at his home – including climate change. Winters in the United Kingdom are ""projected to become warmer and wetter on average,"" the Met Office says on its website, adding that within 50 years, winter will be up to 4.5 degrees Celsius warmer and up to 30% wetter. ""Heavy rainfall is also more likely,"" the office says. ""Since 1998, the UK has seen six of the ten wettest years on record. The winter storms in 2015 were at least 40% more likely because of climate change. ... Parts of the U.K. will be in danger of flooding, with low lying and coastal cities at particular risk.""

Carrefour pulls Doritos and other PepsiCo products from shelves,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/europe-pepsi-doritos-pepsico-carrefour-removal/,"Global supermarket chain Carrefour will stop selling PepsiCo products in it stores in France, Belgium, Spain and Italy over price increases for popular items like Doritos, Lay's potato chips, Quaker Oats, Lipton tea and its namesake soda. The French grocery chain said it pulled PepsiCo products from shelves in France on Thursday and added small signs in stores that say, ""We no longer sell this brand due to unacceptable price increases.""  The ban also will extend to Belgium, Spain and Italy, but Carrefour, which has 12,225 stores in more than 30 countries, didn't say when it would take effect in those three countries. PepsiCo said in a statement that it has ""been in discussion with Carrefour for many months and we will continue to engage in good faith in order to try to ensure that our products are available."" The company behind Cheetos, Mountain Dew and Rice-A-Roni has raised prices by double-digit percentages for seven straight quarters, most recently hiking by 11% in the July-to-September period. Its profits are up, though higher prices have dragged down sales as people trade down to cheaper stores. PepsiCo also has said it's been shrinking package sizes to meet consumer demand for convenience and portion control. Many food producers opted to shrink packaging while charging the same amount —a strategy known as ""shrinkflation""— after supply-chain shocks related to COVID-19 affected many parts of the food chain, contributing to the rising price of everything from berries to corn. Still, some of the world's largest retailers have been accused of usingsoaring inflation ratesas an excuse to raise prices and rake in billions of dollars in additional profit. Late in 2021, the FTClaunched an investigationinto the profit margins of major retailers and consumer-goods companies, including Amazon, Kroger, Walmart, Kraft Heinz and Procter and Gamble. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, said price increases should ease and largely align with inflation, which has fallen considerably worldwide since crunched supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic and then Russia's war in Ukraine sent prices surging. However, the 20 European Union countries that use the euro currency saw consumer prices rise to 2.9% in December from a year earlier, rebounding after seven straight monthly declines, according to numbers released Friday.  Prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks have eased from a painful 17.5% in the 20-country euro area in March but were still up by 6.9% in November from a year earlier. PepsiCo has pointed to higher costs for grain and cooking oil for its rising prices. Those costs surged following Russia's invasion in Ukraine and are still being felt by families at supermarkets. But prices for food commodities like grain that are traded on global markets fell considerably last year from record highs in 2022. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said Friday that its food price index was 13.7% lower in 2023 than the year before, with only its measure of sugar prices growing in that time.",2024-01-05,PepsiCo says price increases should ease and largely align with inflation.

Christopher Nolan heard Peloton instructor rant about his movie,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/peloton-instructor-insulted-christopher-nolan-director-tenet-jenn-sherman/,"A Peloton instructor took time during a class to air her grievances about the movie ""Tenet"" — and the director of the film, Christopher Nolan, happened to take that class. Jenn Sherman, an instructor who leads virtual workout classes for Peloton that can be taken live or on demand, played a song from ""Tenet"" during a cycling class in 2020. She asked the people at home streaming the class if they had seen the move. ""Did anybody see this besides me?"" she asked. ""Because I need a manual. Someone's got to explain this. I'm not kidding."" She kept ranting about the movie, a science fiction written and directed by Nolan. Nolan, 53, has received four Oscar nominations for his movies ""Memento,"" ""Inception,"" and ""Dunkirk,"" and he is also the director behind ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy and this year's ""Oppenheimer,"" a blockbuster that is receiving Oscar buzz. But Sherman was not impressed with ""Tenet."" ""That's two and a half hours of my life that I want back. I want it back,"" she said as she continued to lead the virtual class. Unbeknownst to her, Nolan took that class and heard her comments about his film. But that twist didn't come out until recently, when the director was accepting an award and decided to harken back to the time he was insulted during a Peloton workout. ""I was on my Peloton doing a high interval, some s***, I was gasping, dying, and the instructor started talking about one of my films,"" Nolan said while accepting the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best director for ""Oppenheimer."" He recounted what Sherman said about ""Tenet,"" and joked about the harsh criticism. ""When [film critic] Rex Reed takes a s*** on your film, he doesn't ask you to work out more with him,"" Nolan joked. The quip made headlines — and Sherman knew he was talking about her. So she went on Instagram and issued an apology for her 2020 rant. ""This is a huge day for me, when I come to find out Christopher Nolan — one of the leading filmmakers of the 21st century — knows who the hell I am,"" she said in an Instagram video. ""I was excited. And then I read the article.""

How the Golden Globes is bouncing back after past controversies,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/golden-globes-has-changed-following-past-controversies/,"Hollywood's much-anticipated awards season officially commences with the Golden Globes, airing this Sunday on CBS. The event, known for its lively atmosphere, has a star-studded lineup including several nominations for ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer,"" along with critically acclaimed films like ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" and ""Poor Things."" On the television front, ""Succession"" has emerged as a frontrunner, garnering nearly double the nominations of any other show. It is also set for a notable comeback with several significant changes. A 2021 Los Angeles Times exposé revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association — which serves as the voting body for the awards — had no Black members. Some voters were also accused of making sexist and racist remarks and soliciting favors from celebrities and movie studios. This controversy led NBC to drop the broadcast of the Golden Globes in 2022, only to bring it back the following year after the HFPA implemented reforms including an updated code of conduct, bylaws, a ban on gifts and new rules on travel. In a major organizational shake-up, the HFPA was dissolved in June 2023 after the Golden Globes were acquired by Dick Clark Productions' parent company, Eldridge Industries. Problematic voters were expelled, and the membership expanded from about 85 to 300 — including a 10% Black representation. ""This is their attempt this year to bounce back from probably their most significant controversy yet,"" said Kyle Buchanan, an awards show columnist for The New York Times. ""A lot of people don't really know who the group is. The older Globe voters, you could pick them out of any lineup at any press conference. You know, maybe the new Globes group is more serious and we'll get to know that over the next few years,"" said Buchanan. Another change this year means Taylor Swift could attend the show for her concert film, which is nominated for a brand new category for blockbusters called Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. ""If they can get Taylor in that ballroom, I'm sure they wouldn't mind,"" said Buchanan. Comedian Jo Koy is set to host the show. He told ""Entertainment Tonight"" co-host Nischelle Turner that he has had a whirlwind preparation period of just eight days, receiving support and advice from fellow comedian Chris Rock. The 2024 Golden Globe Awards will take place at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles on Sunday, Jan. 7, at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT), just after the New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on CBS.

""He shared many extraordinary gifts in the world as actor, singer, storyteller, creative artist and dear friend,"" Snell said. ""His smile, laughter and passion for life will be remembered by the many whose lives he has touched."" Soul starred opposite Paul Michael Glaser, who played Detective Dave Starsky, on the popular crime show, which aired from 1975 to 1979. Soul got the role of Hutch after famed producer Aaron Spelling saw him in the 1973 Clint Eastwood movie ""Magnum Force,"" according toSoul's website.     Soul was born in Chicago, but he moved to the U.K. after performing in a play there in the 1990s. He went on to appear in British TV shows and theatrical productions, including playing talk-show host Jerry Springer in ""Jerry Springer - The Opera."" As a musician, he recorded five albums, with '70s singles ""Don't Give Up on Us"" and ""Silver Lady"" topping the charts in the U.K., according to BBC News. In 2004, after other '70s shows ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""S.W.A.T."" were made into feature films,Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson starred in a ""Starsky and Hutch""   movie playing the titular characters. The movie also featured cameos from Soul and Glaser. ""I wasn't quite sure what it was going to be, but what it's morphed into, what it's become is a very good experience,"" Soul said when the movie came out. ""It's two very conscionable guys playing this role, they've got a good relationship. That's what this whole 'Starsky and Hutch' phenomenon was about, it's friendship, that's number one, and that's what Paul and I have had for 30 years, and they've taken that mantel in a sense and are moving on with it in 2004."" Soul is survived by Snell, his six children from previous marriages and seven grandchildren, according to the actor's website. Alex Sundby is a senior editor at CBSNews.com.

How Google is using AI to help reduce traffic and emissions,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-project-green-light-seattle/,"Getting stuck in traffic and hitting several red lights in a row isn't just frustrating and bad for stress levels, it's also bad for the environment. But one U.S. city is getting help from a tech giant and artificial intelligence to solve this problem. Google's Juliet Rothenberg is on a mission to make traffic lights more efficient and less annoying. ""Shift a few seconds from here to there and that shift can have a big impact,"" she told CBS News. Google's new Project Green Light system uses the company's vast maps database and AI to optimize traffic lights around the world. The system suggests changes and city engineers then decide if they want to implement them. ""We had one case where we moved four seconds from a north-south street to an east-west street for a particular time of day, so then that can help reduce some of that stop-and-go traffic,"" Laura Wojcicki, an engineer at Seattle's Department of Transportation, told CBS News. She said a suggestion from Google's system can be implemented in about five minutes. Seattle is the first city in the U.S. to try Project Green Light, but the program is being tested out at 70 intersections in 13 cities around the world, impacting 30 million car trips per month. Google claims the project could reduce stop-and-go traffic by up to 30%. ""It means a lot for drivers and it also means a lot for emissions,"" Rothenberg   said. Half of vehicle emissions at intersections come from cars accelerating after stopping, she said. Google believes it can reduce those emissions by 10% — a welcome reduction considering transportation is the number one source of planet-warming pollution in the U.S. ""Intersections are a really good leverage point for tackling climate,"" Rothenberg   said. Google provides the service for free and plans to expand to thousands of cities, creating what it calls a green wave for drivers.

"African birds of prey show signs of population collapse, researchers say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/african-birds-of-prey-show-signs-of-population-collapse-researchers-say/,"African raptors that hunt during the day face an extinction crisis, with populations decreasing among dozens of species of birds of prey, researchers said in a study published Thursday. Researchers used data from the last 40 years to analyze the populations of 42 of the country's 106 raptor species, they wrote in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. Nearly 90% of the studied species experienced population declines. ""Africa is at a crossroads in terms of saving its magnificent birds of prey,"" Dr. Darcy Ogada, one of the study's authors, said in a press release. ""In many areas we have watched these species nearly disappear."" Ogada, the Africa program director at The Peregrine Fund, warned that the secretarybird — one of the continent's most iconic raptors — is on the brink of extinction. ""There's no single threat imperiling these birds, it's a combination of many human-caused ones,"" Ogada said. ""In other words we are seeing deaths from a thousand cuts."" Several types of vultures, eagles, kestrels, buzzards and falcons are among those at risk. Raptors in Africa have been hurt by the conversion of wooded habitats to agricultural land. ""Since the 1970s, extensive areas of forest and savanna have been converted into farmland, while other pressures affecting African raptors have likewise intensified,"" study author and University of St Andrews professor Dr. Phil Shaw said in a press release. Shaw also pointed to the growth of the country's human population. Africa has the highest rate of population growth among major areas, with the population in sub-Saharan Africa projected to double by 2050, according to the United Nations. It's not just Africa facing declining populations of birds. In a 2019 study, scientists said that the U.S. and Canada have lost 29% of their bird populations — amounting to nearly 3 billion birds. That same year, scientists warned that worldwide, 1 million species of plants and animals were at risk of extinction. Aliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.

Researchers figure out what makes urine yellow,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-makes-urine-yellow-according-to-researchers/,"Ur-ine luck if you've always wondered why pee is yellow. Researchers identified the enzyme responsible for urine's color, unraveling a mystery that's puzzled scientists for years, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Microbiology. ""It's remarkable that an everyday biological phenomenon went unexplained for so long, and our team is excited to be able to explain it,"" Brantley Hall, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland's Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, said in a news statement. Urine is a combination of water, electrolytes and waste that your kidneys filter out from your blood. More than 125 years ago, scientists identified urobilin as the yellow pigment in urine, but they didn't know what was responsible for the urobilin's production. It turns out urine's color is connected to the body's red blood cells, researchers said. As red blood cells degrade, a bright orange pigment called bilirubin is produced. The pigment is typically secreted into the gut, where it can then be excreted or partially reabsorbed. Once the bilirubin arrives in your gut, the microorganisms in your intestines can convert the bilirubin into other molecules, the study found. ""Gut microbes encode the enzyme bilirubin reductase that converts bilirubin into a colorless byproduct called urobilinogen,"" Hall, the study's lead author, said. ""Urobilinogen then spontaneously degrades into a molecule called urobilin, which is responsible for the yellow color we are all familiar with."" The study authors said that before their research, scientists thought there were multiple enzymes involved, rather than a single enzyme. The discovery of the bilirubin reductase enzyme could help researchers learn more about gut health, inflammatory bowel disease and jaundice, researchers said. The research team discovered that the enzyme is present in almost all healthy adults, but is frequently missing from newborns and people with inflammatory bowel disease. ""Now that we've identified this enzyme, we can start investigating how the bacteria in our gut impact circulating bilirubin levels and related health conditions like jaundice,"" study co-author and National Institutes of Health investigator Xiaofang Jiang said. ""This discovery lays the foundation for understanding the gut-liver axis."" Urine from a healthy, hydrated person should be somewhere between colorless, which may be a sign you're drinking too much water, and the color of light straw and honey, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It turns a darker yellow or amber in those who aren't drinking enough. Other colors can come from your diet or medical conditions. Dark brown urine could be a sign of dangerous dehydration, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The color could also mean there's bile in your urine, which is a sign of liver disease. Orange urine is also sometimes a sign of dehydration, but it may also mean you have a liver or bile duct condition. The color could also be tied to food dye or medications. Certain foods and medications can also lead to blue or green urine. According to a Harvard Health post, the antidepressant amitriptyline and the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin can turn urine blue. Pink to reddish color could be a cause for concern, or it could just mean you've been eating beets, blueberries or rhubarb. If those foods haven't been in your diet and your urine is still pink or reddish, there may be cause for concern. The color could be a sign of several conditions, including kidney disease, lead poisoning and certain types of cancer. Aliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.

Health officials are monitoring a triple threat of respiratory illnesses,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-officials-monitoring-a-triple-threat-of-respiratory-illnesses-cdc-covid-rsv-flu/,"As the new year gets underway, health officials are issuing a nationwide alert about a triple threat: The simultaneous spread of the flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting a significant rise in emergency room visits due to flu and COVID-19, while RSV infections continue to pose a serious risk — particularly to infants and the elderly. Dr. Celine Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and KFF Health News editor-at-large for public health, said that the U.S. is seeing a flu spike and a rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations. ""We've had 10,000 people across the U.S. die from COVID since November, so this is definitely not gone,"" said Gounder. With symptoms often overlapping, Gounder said it was important to test to differentiate between the viruses. She also advocated for vaccination and the use of masks, such as N95s, as effective prevention strategies. ""They will not necessarily prevent all infections, but they will prevent you from getting really sick. Especially if you're somebody who doesn't want to miss time at work or at school,"" said Gounder. Comparing the current situation to previous years, Gounder said that this season is better than the last couple since the pandemic started. ""Even before the pandemic bad flu season could really crush the hospital. In terms of the number of patients coming in. And so now you have a whole new virus on top of what we were seeing before. And so there's really not a lot of bandwidth to take on more patients if people get sick,"" said Gounder.",2024-01-05,"CDC reports rise in emergency room visits due to flu and COVID-19.

Evidence photos in the death of Megan Parra,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/megan-ducote-parra-louisiana-death-evidence-photos-48-hours/,"A young mother's death is ruled a suicide, but her father believes she was murdered. See the photos he believes show evidence of homicide. On June 28, 2014, in the tiny town of Cottonport, Louisiana, Steve and Missy Ducote discovered their 29-year-old daughter Megan Parra lying on her living room floor. She had a gunshot wound to the head. Missy Ducote, a nurse practitioner, realized her daughter still had a pulse. When he arrived, Megan's husband Dustin Parra, a nurse himself, also worked to save her. As he rushed in, Dustin Parra slipped in his wife's blood and stained his shorts. The day before her shooting, Megan Parra had a car accident. She was alone when she veered off a road and hit a tree. A state trooper noted that there were no skid marks indicating she had attempted to stop the car. When asked about the crash, Megan Parra said she had tried to stop but her brakes didn't work, and she hit the tree to avoid the river. David Blanchard was the first officer to arrive at the shooting. He took over 100 photos of the scene, including this one of a gun found near Megan Parra. It belonged to Dustin Parra. This note was discovered on the kitchen counter and photographed by Officer Blanchard. It appears to be a note from Megan Parra to the couple's two young sons, ages 4 and 18 months. Megan's father Steve Ducote believes that someone else wrote the note. He insists it doesn't look like her handwriting. The morning of the shooting, Megan Parra was airlifted to a trauma center in Lafayette, Louisiana. After less than 24 hours on life support, Megan was taken off and passed away. Her organs were donated. Two days after Megan Parra's death, Steve Ducote says the lead detective on the case, Christopher Knight, showed up at his house and told him that he had tested the gun that killed Megan Parra, and her fingerprints were all over it. Knight denies ever saying he tested the gun. Within days, Knight declared Megan Parra's death a suicide in a one-page report. Within weeks, an autopsy report also declared her manner of death as suicide. Steve Ducote soon learned that the gun that killed Megan Parra could not have been tested for fingerprints that quickly. Knight would later state that he had not sent it out for testing. Steve and Missy Ducote soon became suspicious of their son-in-law Dustin Parra. He had been at a Walmart the morning of the shooting, though Megan's family says he told different accounts of exactly where he was when Steve Ducote called to tell him Megan had been shot. Four months after the shooting, Steve Ducote convinced a local judge that the case should be reopened. That judge asked Commander Dan Schaub of the Avoyelles Parish Sheriff's Office to review the case.  Schaub reviewed the photos taken at the scene along with Knight's one-page report. Schaub also spoke with two neighbors who thought they heard a gunshot that morning -- but at two different times.  Schaub says the neighbor to the right said she heard a very loud ""boom"" a little after 7 a.m. But the neighbor to the left said he heard a gunshot around 9:15 a.m. Schaub found the neighbor to the left more reliable, so he created a timeline that assumed Megan Parra had been shot around 9:15 a.m. The question became could Dustin Parra have been home? Dustin Parra told everyone that the morning of the shooting, he was at a local Walmart picking up prescriptions for Megan. Schaub found a time-stamped receipt showing that Dustin paid for the medications at 9:43 a.m. Schaub then released an eight-page report concluding that Dustin Parra was at Walmart when his wife shot herself. Although Steve Ducote was disappointed by Schaub's conclusion, he now had something that would prove invaluable: copies of the photos taken at the scene by Blanchard. Steve Ducote and his eldest daughter Betsy Jeansonne began studying them. Steve Ducote and Betsy Jeansonne believe several photos show signs of a struggle, like a wine rack seemingly out of place behind a chair. Megan Parra's autopsy report had noted that the gun had been in direct contact with her temple when it went off, but Steve Ducote says he noticed that in this photo of the gun, it looks clean. Had someone wiped it after the shooting? Megan Parra's parents say that after Dustin Parra ran into the room and slid in his wife's blood, he reached into her shirt pocket and pulled out this picture of their boys. Steve Ducote began to believe that Dustin Parra planted the picture. ""If you gonna make it look like suicide, you're going to do things like that,"" Steve Ducote said. Megan Parra's family pushed for answers for years without success, until Steve Ducote called an old friend, a retired FBI agent now living in Nebraska named David Lemoine. In 2018, more than four years after Megan was shot, Lemoine flew to Cottonport, met with Ducote and spent the night reviewing a binder of evidence compiled by the Ducotes. By the next morning he came to the conclusion that Megan had been murdered. Lemoine recruited fellow retired FBI agent Zack Shelton to help him investigate. In 2019 they were deputized as police officers by the Cottonport police chief. That allowed the former special agents to interview witnesses and record them on bodycam. On Jan. 15, 2019, David Lemoine and Zack Shelton interviewed Det. Christopher Knight. He admitted that he should have investigated more thoroughly, citing his lack of experience as an investigator at the time. He told Lemoine and Shelton, ""if I botched this, you know, then I mean … my fault, you know. But was it done -- but was it done on purpose? Absolutely not."" Lemoine and Shelton also questioned Dustin Parra for more than an hour. He admitted that not long before Megan Parra's death, he had been having an affair, but didn't think his wife knew about it. He insisted that he had nothing to do with his wife's death.  ""Maybe she shot herself in front of you. I don't know, but you were there,"" Zack Shelton said. Dustin Parra replied, ""when she was shot, I was not there."" David Lemoine worked on Megan's case for two years, but never got to see the resolution. Lemoine passed away on Dec. 28, 2020, after contracting COVID-19. In April 2021, a still-determined Steve Ducote hired independent crime scene analyst Eric Richardson to look over the evidence.  It was a photo of the shorts worn by Dustin Parra the morning of the shooting that caught Richardson's attention. He noticed a fine mist of blood near one of the pockets that he says can only be caused by high velocity blood spatter. To Richardson, that means Dustin Parra had to be there when the gun went off. On Oct. 13, 2021, Avoyelles Parish District Attorney Charles Riddle took the case to a grand jury. It returned a charge of second-degree murder. Dustin Parra was arrested and pleaded not guilty. It was not an open-and-shut case says Riddle. He says state and local law enforcement experts were going to testify that the blood spatter on Dustin Parra's shorts did not prove he was present when the gun went off. Remember, Dustin had slid in Megan's blood, and had worked to save her life. On March 24, 2023, just three days before Dustin Parra's murder trial was set to begin, his attorney offered a deal. After speaking with the district attorney to discuss their options, Steve and Missy Ducote accepted the deal. On March 26, 2023, Dustin Parra pleaded ""nolo contendere"" or no contest to negligent homicide in the death of Megan Parra. During the plea hearing, Dustin Parra had to answer several questions and admit that he had the gun in his hand during a struggle with Megan and it went off firing into her head.  ""To us, as a family, him admitting to that, that was huge,"" Steve Ducote says. Dustin Parra was sentenced to five years but will likely serve only 18 months in prison and the rest on parole.  Megan Parra's sons had been living with Dustin Parra ever since the shooting -- but that changed on April 20, 2023. After petitioning the court, Missy and Steve Ducote were granted full custody of their grandsons. For the Ducote family, life without Megan will never be the same. ""Megan … was one of the most charitable people I knew,"" Betsy Jeansonne recalled to David Begnaud through tears. ""She was always so giving of herself ... She was the most amazing mother ... She was my little sister … but I really looked up to her."" When asked what Megan would say to him if she could, Steve Ducote said, ""take care of those boys, and probably say thanks for not giving up.""",2024-01-05,"Megan Parra's family pushed for answers for years without success.

The shooting began early in the morning, before most students were at the school, officials said Thursday. Police received reports of the shooting at 7:37 a.m. and were on the site within seven minutes to find students and faculty sheltering in place and fleeing the building. One sixth-grader — later identified as 11-year-old Amir Jolliff, a student at Perry Middle School — was killed, according to the Iowa Department of Public Safety. Four other students and three school staff members were injured, the agency said Friday. Officials had initially reported a total of five injured. Among those wounded was Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger, who remained hospitalized in critical condition Friday along with two other students, Iowa DPS said. The shooter, identified as 17-year-old Dylan Butler — a student at the high school — died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. Claire Marburger said in a lengthy Facebook postthat her father had been in surgery after the shooting and was in stable condition when she wrote the post late Thursday night. She did not elaborate on his injuries, but said they had been sustained while trying to talk down the shooter. ""As I heard of a gunman, I instantly had a feeling my Dad would be a victim as he would put himself in harms way for the benefit of the kids and his staff,"" Claire Marburger wrote. ""It is absolutely zero surprise to hear he tried to approach and talk (the shooter) down and distract him long enough for some students to get out of the cafeteria. That's just Dad."" Claire Marburger described her father as a ""gentle giant"" and ""amazing person"" who would be ""devastated about what happened"" at Perry High School. ""Its things like this that he takes personally.. what more could he do, what did he not do that he could have... he'd be extremely saddened (by) the trauma and negative memories that are associated with his building and school now for many,"" she wrote. Marburger asked that people share ""positive memories"" about the school, community or her father. She also asked that people express their well-wishes to the other victims' families, and to ""show grace"" to the family of the shooter.

"NASA releases new images of solar system's ""most volcanic world""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-spacecraft-juno-io-jupiter-moon-volcano-approach/,"A NASA spacecraft made its closest-ever approach to Jupiter's moon Io, coming within 930 miles of the ""surface of the most volcanic world,"" and the space agency released new images of the flyby.  The spacecraft, Juno, has been circling Jupiter since 2016. Since then, it has orbited the planet to learn more about the gas giant and its moons, NASA said. Io, one of Jupiter's moons, is a ""turbulent world"" that is ""dotted with hundreds of volcanoes,"" NASA said. Some of those volcanoes have eruptions so powerful that they can be seen by telescopes on Earth. It's one of 95 moons orbiting Jupiter, and exists in a ""gravitational tug-of-war"" between nearby moons and the planet itself. That creates tidal forces causing the surface to flex by as much as 330 feet, according to NASA. The data from Juno's flyby of Io has not yet been processed by NASA, but researchers said they were looking for more information on those volcanoes. Some photos from the flyby were posted online. ""By combining data from this flyby with our previous observations, the Juno science team is studying how Io's volcanoes vary,"" said Juno's principal investigator, Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, in a news release from NASA. ""We are looking for how often they erupt, how bright and hot they are, how the shape of the lava flow changes, and how Io's activity is connected to the flow of charged particles in Jupiter's magnetosphere."" All three of the cameras aboard the spacecraft were set to be active during the flyby. One camera, called the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper, used infrared instruments to record heat signatures emitted by volcanoes on Io. A second camera, called the Stellar Reference Unit, will obtain high-resolution surface images, and what NASA calls the JunoCam will ""take visible-light color images,"" which results in images akin to satellite photographs. The photos posted online by NASA were taken by the JunoCam. The spacecraft will fly past Io again on February 3, coming again within 930 miles of the moon's surface. After that, NASA says the spacecraft will fly past Io every other orbit, though it will progressively move farther away, for a total of 18 flybys throughout Io's mission to Jupiter. ""With our pair of close flybys in December and February, Juno will investigate the source of Io's massive volcanic activity, whether a magma ocean exists underneath its crust, and the importance of tidal forces from Jupiter, which are relentlessly squeezing this tortured moon,"" said Bolton.",2024-01-05,"NASA's Juno spacecraft made its closest-ever approach to Jupiter's moon Io.

"In launch doubleheader, SpaceX puts spaceplane and Starlinks in orbit",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launch-doubleheader-military-x-37b-spaceplane-starlink/,"Kicking off a sky-lighting launch doubleheader, a powerful SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket vaulted away from the Kennedy Space Center on Thursday atop a torrent of flaming exhaust to put an unpiloted X-37B spaceplane into orbit for a classified, long-duration military mission. At the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, another team of SpaceX engineers launched a workhorse single-core Falcon 9 rocket just two hours and 54 minutes later, thought to be the shortest span between two U.S. orbit-class missions since the mid 1960s. The two flights were SpaceX's 95th and 96th so far this year. The Falcon Heavy got off first, putting on a spectacular show for area residents and tourists as its 27 Merlin engines, nine in each of three strapped-together Falcon 9 boosters, ignited with a rush of flame and a ground-shaking roar at 8:07 p.m. EST. The rocket then climbed away from the Kennedy Space Center atop more than five million pounds of thrust, and lined up on a northeasterly trajectory, rapidly accelerating as the engines consumed propellants and the vehicle lost weight. The launching originally was scheduled for Dec. 10, but the flight was delayed by predicted bad weather and then by trouble with ground equipment. The rocket was hauled off the launch pad and back to a SpaceX hangar for subsequent work. It was rolled back out to pad 39A earlier this week. This time around, it was clear sailing. The two side boosters, each making their fifth flight, helped power the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away from the core stage two-and-a-half minutes after launch. They immediately flipped around, reversed course and headed back toward the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Heralded by window-rattling sonic booms, both boosters settled to picture-perfect touchdowns, the 40th and 41st to land in Florida. The central core stage's nine engines continued firing for a minute and a half after the two strap-ons separated before it, too, shut down and separated from the Falcon Heavy's second stage. Unlike the side boosters, the core stage was expected to use up all of its propellant and no recovery was planned. No details about the second stage's climb to the spaceplane's intended orbit were released. As usual with such classified military missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary after the side booster landings about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. With the Falcon Heavy off the ground, SpaceX engineers at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station pressed ahead with launch of the single-core Falcon 9 and its payload of 23 Starlink satellites. Going into the flight, SpaceX had launched 5,627 Starlinks in 131 flights dating back to May 2019. Of the total launched to date, space statistician Jonathan McDowell said 5,211 were presumed functional. Thursday's flight boosted the total number of Starlinks launched so far this year to 1,984 across 63 Falcon 9 flights. The Falcon Heavy, meanwhile, chalked up the rocket's ninth flight while the X-37B is making that program's seventh. Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis. The Boeing-built X-37B looks a bit like a miniature space shuttle, complete with delta wings, heat shield tiles and a compact payload bay. Unlike NASA's space shuttle, which relied on fuel cells for power in orbit, the X-37B is equipped with an extendable solar array that allows for extremely long flights. The compact orbiters are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle. The most recent flight of an X-37B began with launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket on May 17, 2020. It ended Nov. 12, 2022, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 908 days and 21 hours in space. Through the program's six previous flights dating back to the first launch in April 2010, the two X-37Bs logged a combined 10.3 years in space. The planned duration of the latest mission has not been announced.

6 exciting space missions set to launch in 2024,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/space-missions-launch-2024-artemis-clipper-viper-moon-mars/,"Ali M. Bramsonis an assistant professor of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences atPurdue University. The year 2023 proved to be an important one for space missions, with NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission returning a sample from an asteroid and India's Chandrayaan-3 mission exploring the lunar south pole, and 2024 is shaping up to be another exciting year for space exploration. Several new missions under NASA's Artemis plan and Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative will target the moon. The latter half of the year will feature several exciting launches, with the launch of the Martian Moons eXploration mission in September, Europa Clipper and Hera in October and Artemis II and VIPER to the Moon in November – if everything goes as planned. I'm a planetary scientist, and here are six of the space missions I'm most excited to follow in 2024. NASA will launch Europa Clipper, which will explore one of Jupiter's largest moons, Europa. Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, with a surface made of ice. Beneath its icy shell, Europa likely harbors a saltwater ocean, which scientists expect contains over twice as much water as all the oceans here on Earth combined. With Europa Clipper, scientists want to investigate whether Europa's ocean could be a suitable habitat for extraterrestrial life. The mission plans to do this by flying past Europa nearly 50 times to study the moon's icy shell, its surface's geology and its subsurface ocean. The mission will also look for active geysers spewing out from Europa. This mission will change the game for scientists hoping to understand ocean worlds like Europa.  The launch window – the period when the mission could launch and achieve its planned route – opens Oct. 10, 2024, and lasts 21 days. The spacecraft will launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket and arrive at the Jupiter system in 2030. The Artemis program, named after Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology, is NASA's plan to go back to the moon. It will send humans to the moon for the first time since 1972, including the first woman and the first person of color. Artemis also includes plans for a longer-term, sustained presence in space that will prepare NASA for eventually sending people even farther – to Mars. Artemis II is the first crewed step in this plan, with four astronauts planned to be on board during the 10-day mission. The mission builds upon Artemis I, which sent an uncrewed capsule into orbit around the moon in late 2022. Artemis II will put the astronauts into orbit around the moon before returning them home. It is currently planned for launch as early as November 2024. But there is a chance it will get pushed back to 2025, depending on whether all the necessary gear, such as spacesuits and oxygen equipment, is ready. VIPER, which stands for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, is a robot the size of a golf cart that NASA will use to explore the moon's south pole in late 2024.  Originally scheduled for launch in 2023, NASA pushed the mission back to complete more tests on the lander system, which Astrobotic, a private company, developed as part of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. This robotic mission is designed to search for volatiles, which are molecules that easily vaporize, like water and carbon dioxide, at lunar temperatures. These materials could provide resources for future human exploration on the moon. The VIPER robot will rely on batteries, heat pipes and radiators throughout its 100-day mission, as it navigates everything from the extreme heat of lunar daylight – when temperatures can reach 224 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) – to the moon's frigid shadowed regions that can reach a mind-boggling -400 F (-240 C). VIPER's launch and delivery to the lunar surface is scheduled for November 2024. NASA has recently invested in a class of small, low-cost planetary missions called SIMPLEx, which stands for Small, Innovative Missions for PLanetary Exploration. These missions save costs by tagging along on other launches as what is called a rideshare, or secondary payload.  One example is the Lunar Trailblazer. Like VIPER, Lunar Trailblazer will look for water on the moon.  But while VIPER will land on the Moon's surface, studying a specific area near the south pole in detail, Lunar Trailblazer will orbit the moon, measuring the temperature of the surface and mapping out the locations of water molecules across the globe.  Currently, Lunar Trailblazer is on track to be ready by early 2024. However, because it is a secondary payload, Lunar Trailblazer's launch timing depends on the primary payload's launch readiness. The PRIME-1 mission, scheduled for a mid-2024 launch, is Lunar Trailblazer's ride. PRIME-1 will drill into the moon – it's a test run for the kind of drill that VIPER will use. But its launch date will likely depend on whether earlier launches go on time.  An earlier Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission with the same landing partner was pushed back to February 2024 at the earliest, and further delays could push back PRIME-1 and Lunar Trailblazer. While Earth's moon has many visitors – big and small, robotic and crewed – planned for 2024, Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos will soon be getting a visitor as well. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, has a robotic mission in development called the Martian Moon eXploration, or MMX, planned for launch around September 2024.  The mission's main science objective is to determine the origin of Mars' moons. Scientists aren't sure whether Phobos and Deimos are former asteroids that Mars captured into orbit with its gravity or if they formed out of debris that was already in orbit around Mars. The spacecraft will spend three years around Mars conducting science operations to observe Phobos and Deimos. MMX will also land on Phobos' surface and collect a sample before returning to Earth.  Hera is a mission by the European Space Agency to return to the Didymos-Dimorphos asteroid system that NASA's DART mission visited in 2022. But DART didn't just visit these asteroids, it collided with one of them to test a planetary defense technique called ""kinetic impact."" DART hit Dimorphos with such force that it actually changed its orbit. The kinetic impact technique smashes something into an object in order to alter its path. This could prove useful if humanity ever finds a potentially hazardous object on a collision course with Earth and needs to redirect it. Hera will launch in October 2024, making its way in late 2026 to Didymos and Dimorphos, where it will study physical properties of the asteroids.

"When and where to see tonight's Cold Moon, last full moon of 2023",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-and-where-to-see-the-cold-moon-the-longest-and-last-full-moon-of-2023/,"The longest — and last — full moon of the year appeared on Monday night and will peak on Tuesday. December's full moon, also known as the Cold Moon and Long Night Moon, will reach peak illumination at 7:33 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to NASA. It will look like a full moon until Thursday morning. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the United States. To view the full moon, it's not rocket science: NASA recommends going outside and looking upat the sky. Using a telescope or binocularswill magnify the moon and clarify details on its surface. Local forecasts have detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in different locations where people are keeping an eye out for the moon. December's full moon gets its Cold Moon moniker from Mohawk traditions, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is based on the frigid conditions of the time of year. The full moon is also called the Long Night Moon because December's full moon occurs near the winter solstice, which has the longest night of the year. This year's solstice was on Dec. 21. ""The full moon takes a high trajectory across the sky because it is opposite to the low sun, so the moon will be above the horizon longer than at other times of the year,"" according to NASA. Other names for December's full moon include Drift Clearing Moon, Frost Exploding Trees Moon, Moon of the Popping Trees, Hoar Frost Moon, Snow Moon, Winter Maker Moon, Moon When the Deer Shed Their Antlers and Little Spirit Moon, according to the Farmer's Almanac. Ancient pagans in Europe called the December full Moon the Moon Before Yule. ""No matter the name, we're a big fan,"" NASA said Tuesday on one of its social media accounts. Next month's full moon is dubbed the Wolf Moon. It will peak on Jan. 25. December's full moon does fall on Christmas sometimes, but it's a rare occasion. The last full moon to peak on Christmas was in 2015. Before that, there hadn't been one since 1977. Astronomers say the next Christmas full moon won't be until 2034.
